## The Fourth Color

As I said, I'm going to start you off with a blockbuster. That is, one of those things that is really deeply fascinating and it has to do with the nature of life itself, it has to do with the nature of the illusion of this life that we live. This illusion that's us, it's the Monopole that does this work. It's the Monopole, and we've had enough discussions of this, the Monopole that holds us together in the illusion of our separateness. And how does the Monopole do that? It does that through capture frequency.

What is it capturing? This is really where it all begins. If you go back to my earliest discussions about the nature of Color and my earliest comments about the various Colors, one of the things I stressed from the beginning is that the whole nature of transference, all of that, and the fact that it is the transference that allows the capture frequency to operate, all of that is because of the 4 Color; all of it.

## The Monopole Simply Captures

Let's think about it for a moment in terms of what's really going on here in this illustration. You have something taking place at incredible speeds at a subatomic level. It is graphically simple for us to be able to do Base, Tone and Color and say entry frequency, inner frequency and exit frequency. But it's something to really understand that at that level, at that speed, that the exit frequency, it is going to be incredibly difficult to distinguish any difference between the exit frequency going out of one of my crystals and the exit frequency going out of one of yours. This is the first thing to grasp.

In other words, there is a generic frequency, if I can put it that way, a quality perhaps in frequency that is what, in fact, the Monopole is going to connect to. One of the most difficult things to grasp about this illusion ishow does that actually work. It's not like the Monopole is distinguishing between nuances of Color. It isn't. The Monopole is simply capturing. It's not intelligent; after all, it's just a mechanism. So it's capturing. It has the ability to capture something.

That something is a quality that is inherent in that exit frequency. But that exit frequency, as I said, would be extraordinary difficult, other than with the knowledge that we have, to actually be able to tell the difference in the exit frequencies because every single exit frequency, regardless of what the Color is underneath, all carry the same quality, a quality that is essential otherwise it can't be captured. And where does that come from?

Let's go back a step. This is the 4 Color in this schematic. And there is something to grasp about the 4 Color, what it means for everything else underneath and what it means for everything else above. Remember, this is deeply nuanced, this knowledge. One has to be careful about the way in which you translate this.

### Everything Carries Some Kind of 4 Color Value

But the first thing I can say to you is that there is only one Color. That's the thing that's so interesting, isn't it? It isn't to say there aren't variations. But in essence everything carries some kind of 4 Color value. And that 4 Color value, it's that value that the Magnetic Monopole recognizes and the Magnetic Monopole captures. The thing to understand about the 4 is that everything is of it. So the themes of 4 transference that we talked about, the way in which the 4 can transfer not simply to the 1 which is opposite to it, but it can transfer in all these different directions not because it is going to them, but in a sense they are already of it. In order for the Monopole to be able to do its job and to be able to capture, it has to have this quality.Think about that. Think about what that means about the 4s wherever you see them at any level that you see them. Let's talk about the hexagram and the construct of the hexagram and the way in which there is a shift in the hexagram between the 3 and the 4. One of the things to grasp about the 4 is that it is a marker. It is a marker that, because of what it is, by the time it gets to the surface in line structure, it is in a sense creating the trigram. Everything comes from below.

### The PHS 4th Internal Color is a Universal Principle

When you think about the 4th Color, let's think about it in universal terms for a moment. Again, remember this is an intellectual indulgence, this journey. Let's just enjoy the journey before there are any conclusions. Think about the 4th Color on the Design side. Think about the 4 as it relates to dietary regimen. And let's think about this as a universal principle, not simply a specific circumstance of dietary regimen, but really something universal because, in fact, the 4 is a universal element. It is a grail element. Everything is in it. Everything, in a sense, is deeply, deeply connected to it despite the fact that they display other attributes.

So, when you think about it on the Design side and you're looking at the internal and the moment you think about calm and nervous, the first thing to understand is that everything else came out of that, because that's the universal principle. We tend to look at things the way in which the hexagram gives us the construct from the 1 up to the 6. So, we see an evolutionary pattern, the way I describe it to you, that evolutionary pattern that always is moving in that configuration.

But there is a deeper evolutionary truth, because here within the crystal, when you see the 4 this way, you see that calm and nervous is the starting principle that divides the binary of what we are as a species. It is a vast, vast generalization. Not just simply that it is specific for anyone who is a 4 on the Design side, like me, as an example. But it's more than that. It's like global cycles as a background frequency; it is a background frequency because everything is connected to it.

Oh, at least it took all kinds of very refined insights into the way in which dietary regimen is going to operate. The fact is that we know calm and nervous is a left/right phenomena. So, in fact, whenever you look at anybody's dietary regimen you should also look at the left/right for their calmness/nervousness. Because those conditions, because they are universal, will always apply and one is going to be better for them than the other, even though it is not specific for them.

It's quite something to think about. When I was first laying out the foundations of Color, the last thing that I wanted to do was explain what the 4 really was, because then you get caught up in seeing everything through its lens, which is very dangerous, because it doesn't work that way. Remember, I'm deconstructing, I'm showing you how something works. Yes, the phenomenon is there. But the natural 3-2-1-5-6 that is the natural Color of somebody's design, that is going to stand on its own. It's just important to understand that it is connected, that it's relevant, that it is a source and as such, you begin to see the basic elements. You begin to see how the basic elements, if we look at them through Variable, how this 4 is establishing a certain mean, if you will, because it's the bedrock.

### All Things are Externalized Out of the 4

It is out of the 4 that all things are externalized. I think only now can you really begin to grasp why it has this keynote--externalization. That's its whole story. It is the externalizing instrument. It's what the Monopole recognizes. It's what the Monopole captures. It is what is inherent as a quality of the 4, this quality that is there in every distinct nuanced frequency of the other exit frequency of the Colors. Everything is the 4. So that the Monopole can recognize it and the Monopole can pick it up.

Environmentally, we know it's Mountains. It's interesting--take the high ground; the high ground is really the root of things. It's interesting about that because the reduction of oxygen is something that benefits clarity of mind, inspiration, and awareness. Everything is out of the 4, everything. It gives the 4th line, as an example, a whole different value when you're looking at it.

And what do you see? The want, the motivation of need. If you put all of the elements of the 4 together, what you have is a basic foundation blueprint for existence and order, to externalize the cognition, to externalize the differentiated potential, to externalize the living consciousness field, to externalize all of it. _[A list of '4' keynotes are at the end of this lesson.]_ And every element carries this externalizing engine because it's the only thing that the Monopole will capture. It will not capture anything else.

This line that's here, this is where the whole story is. This happens to be a specific mapping. These two illustrations _[below & page 2]_ are part of a package of illustrations that I used in _The Complete Guide to the Human Design System_ as a way of illustrating basics, the way in which programming takes place. But it is really something to understand how profound the influence is of this. And to understand that everything else is dependent on this because this is the only thing that gets across the barrier.

So, what does it tell us about the 4? What does it say about the 4? If you begin to distill everything that we understand about the 4s and the various keynotes, if you begin to look at this, this is where--there is a life program. There is a basic, basic life pro gram. It's why the 4 is the master and the novice. It's the basic life program. It is something very, very special to see, to see it in this context, to see it as more primitive, in a sense, than anything else because it is the basic frequency. It is what the Monopole captures.

It's why everything can be so easily distorted. It's why it's so easy for transference and distraction to take place. It's built into this. But to isolate it, to take it out of context, to deconstruct the 4 is to begin to get very, very close to the life program, because it's what we're looking at. Very close to that basic binary that is going to drive the juxtaposition that is life. And that basic binary that is going to be determined by the left-ness and the right-ness is going to be determined inside.

### Everything is about Getting the Tone to the Line

That frequency inside is the most complex of all the frequencies. Not only is there a frequency, but there is even an echo because it's taking place within an interior structure with many ways in which the frequency can be distorted, reoriented, whatever the case may be before the actual exit. Again, I have to caution you at what level all of this is taking place. Yet, it is here within the Tone, the tonal architecture, the tonal cognition, everything about the program is to get us to a place where the cognition can be realized on the surface.Everything is about getting the Tone to the line. This is the whole story. And the Tone itself is at the mercy of the Color, everything is. When you get right down to it, everything that determines our existence, ultimately, is rooted in what the 4th Color is; everything. It's one of those, for me, fascinating little items. Think about all these crystals. Think about all the life forces that are held together in the illusion of their existence. It's not like there is some kind of bizarrely unique instrument for each of the captures. There isn't. These are formulas. It's the combinations that create differentiation. All of this is based on just logical patterns.

There is a mechanism. It's what makes capture frequency so extraordinary because here is where the mechanism is. But what is it capturing? It's not just a matter that it is capturing or distinguishing, it's not awareness. It's not distinguishing the unique potentials of the frequencies. It isn't. It is simply capturing. And what it is capturing is a unique quality that is both archetypically expressed in the 4, but is present in everything else. As far as the Magnetic Monopole is concerned, everything is a 4. It's the distortion in the nuances we live out as a problem. That's our thing; we have to deal with that, don't we?

We're programmed from the bottom up. This relationship between Base and Color, both of them are basically one thing. It's what makes them both so interesting. Base has this space as an illusion in its core. There is always, regardless of whether you're looking at from one side or the other, going to be an element in the core which is the juxtaposition, the whole that's greater than the sum of all the other parts.

You can see that the Tone is the place where, in essence, the diversity of possibilities truly emerges. There is no--well, there is actually, it's not even correct for me to say that because you all know in our tonal architecture that we have all of those six elements but there is the seventh which is the unifying element of sound. In fact, all of them are rooted in some kind of an oneness. And in fact, you can take that journey through them; take that journey through that particular singularity that expresses the root of the nuances, because it's really what it is. It makes the 4 very special.

### The Master/Novice is the Universal Element

I don't think, frankly, in an analytical sense that it adds significance to the way in which it's lived out in any kind of personal level. But in a transpersonal level, it's very powerful. Think about the master and the novice. Here you have a classic 4theme. In thinking about the master and the novice, to recognize that if, in fact, what I am suggesting to you that there is only the 4, that the master and the novice becomes the bedrock upon which everything about our evolutionary awareness develops, and it seems like an obvious, doesn't it? Everything comes out of that master/novice. All the other trajectories, all of the other plays that are there are rooted in the master/novice. It is the universal element.

Wherever you look at the 4s it is what you're going to see. So, we, all of us, regardless of our roles, regardless of our designs, the master/novice is something that we need in our lives on all sides. It is one of those basic elements because we are a communicative species and everything about the way in which our evolution is supposed to take place is as much cultural as it is biological. Every day that I do my work I come to a place of deeper and deeper recognition of how profound the seven-centered consciousness permeates life on this planet. It permeates it, locks it in, and doesn't allow it to breathe, because it doesn't really allow it to breathe.

The Program is an incredibly dense thing. These elements in the 4 are ancient elements. They are ancient elements that were the bedrock of the rise of the seven-centered being. We have a real problem in being able to shed the raison, the reason for existence that we've inherited from the seven-centered being. We don't know how to take that burden. And when I say we don't know, I mean the homogenized world does not know how to take that burden off.

And the doors are closing. Everything about the seven-centered being was about fear; fear at every level you can imagine, fear, fear, fear, fear. And every single attribute that's here, every single attribute that flowed through the master/novice--because remember it all flows through the master/novice--what do we learn, what are we taught? The homogenized world has taken hold of this universal theme and it chokes us with it. What are they taught? Who are their masters? Where are they being lead?

I'm a dualist. I can see the good, the bad, the holy and horrendous in anything. And I can see the horrendous in this as much as I can see the holy. Whenever you smell the nasty side, you look to the homogenized world because it takes everything out of balance. These basic themes have been distorted. This is what we have. We have a world in which the underlying magic, the underlying beauty, the underlying magnificence of what it is to be a nine-centered being, we are incredible creatures.

You know those wonderful flowers, you wait for them and you wait for them and you wait for them and they come, and they don't stay long. I have a pond. Every once in a while there is a water lily. There's nothing more beautiful, at least in my eye, than a water lily, fresh, just opening up in the light floating on the water. It's a magnificent thing. Then it's gone. That's us. That is where we are. That is what the nine-centered being is about. We are transitional form. We are walking out of the human process, entering in to a rave process. This is the end.

It doesn't matter that it takes one thousand plus years; it's not the point. In evolutionary time this is absolutely nothing. It's about now. It's about understanding that if we don't take this shroud off our shoulders we are going to be tormented by the primitive root of all capture, the distortion of it that we must bow down, that we are either novice or master in the way the homogenized world moves over us. We're caught in it. How distorting it becomes. And it's dangerous. It's infective. It's the great externalizing agent.

So, everybody is concerned about need. That need just sits there. And the homogenized not-self world rides that. Oh, do they ride that. Incredible. But there are other things, as we know. The denser the conscious, the less able it is to be able to live out the sophistication of the nuances. What it means to be able to live out your design, this is really something. In the homogenized world all we get is distorted themes. Oh yes, it is wonderful to see the way it actually works. Yes, this is the way the Monopole can capture, but what a price to pay when the world is unaware, shrouded in their seven-centered fears and doomed with them.

Do you see how those fears are alive today? It's a separate issue, we know that, global cycle; times are changing. The bottom is falling out of the great bargain that has held this age together. And these themes that sit there, how they become distorted, how they become totally wrapped with the homogenized world's ability to simply coat this over everybody and give this to everybody as their patina. Most of them out there, because they are transferred, because they are homogenized, they have no access. They're thriving on transference. This is where the 4 lives. This is how it gets to put its quality into everything. And that quality becomes an underlying theme.

Think about it. Think about the way in which the homogenized world sees the difference between those who are high up and those who are low down. It feeds off the tensions of the calm and the nervous. All of that becomes an underlying theme in the way homogenized humanity is held to a dumb frequency, a soup of a frequency that the Monopole captures because the quality is there. But the distortion is built into it and the not-self transferred distracted being is loose in the world.

### Color Brings the Cognitive Information

It's quite something. I look at the surface and what I see on the surface is theatrics. I don't mean to be literal or anything, but when I look at the line or I look at the gate, I am looking at a script. It's about what you bring to the script that make it different and brings it alive and creates its uniqueness. And how you bring things to that script? You bring them with Color. It is Color that is carrying the cognitive information. How else can you bring beauty to your life? There is no other way.

### The Homogenized World is Furniture

Think about the homogenized world. And when you think about the homogenized world and you look at all the beings, you notice something right away. When I'm rude, I call it furniture. Many years ago, long before I was Ra Uru Hu, I was a magazine publisher, a fashion magazine, actually. I was doing a particular spread, whatever it was, and I had hired a photographer and his team and they brought in all kinds of models and whatever. At some point I came down to the studio to see what was going on. As I came in, the chief photographer, the director of all of that, I heard them shout to somebody, I need furniture. I was young; I was in my 20s. I was rather naive. I was wondering what furniture and from where. I was expecting sofas and couches.

No, no, lo and behold his assistant walked in dragging two or three models behind him. That was furniture. It stayed with me, obviously. I found it so astonishing. It is only in all of these years since, which it has taken on almost a comic level, a tragic comic level, I guess, is the fairest way to say that. This is what the homogenized world is. It's furniture.

I love the metaphor of a movie. Movies have their stars. They have their leading characters. They have those people who actually speak. They have talking roles; that kind of stuff. But in every single scene, in order for a scene to have any semblance of life, there is furniture. There are people in the background doing things, seeming to be talking to each other, involved in activities, or whatever. They don't say anything. They're lucky if they're remembered at the end of the film. And quite frankly, most people never watch all those credits to even know they were even there. It can be one of the tragedies of life.

## The 4: The Great Furniture Number

I think this is what the 4 really brings. This is the--I hope you're laughing out there, I can't hear you--this is the great furniture number. This is what creates that, creates this homogenized way in which you bring that spirit to what is fundamentally a performance. Think about this whole business here. When you come into Human Design you think lines are really important. I'm not suggesting they're not. But when you come in you think you have it, you know your lines, you dig down below the surface of your definition and your Strategy and Authority, here are all these little nuances and you think, "Yes, that's me."

You take any line and you know that there are zillions of people who have that line. They all have that line. There is no such thing as a unique line. There is a unique performance of that line. Ive seen so many people play Hamlet. I really have. I think I've seen in stage, film and television I guess maybe 20, 25 performances. I only really remember one or two. I think that this is one of those things about the nature of a line. It's how you deliver it. It's what you bring to it. It is the intelligence behind it. It is the feeling behind it. It is the awareness behind it. It is the experience behind it. It is the depth that's behind it. It's the purity; whatever it is.

## The Importance of the Correct Relationship of the Color to the Line

Have you ever seen one of those terrible audition scenes where you have 20 people who are going to read the same line to try to get the job? This is what the line is; it's a line. This is the mask. This is the way the shell interacts with other shells. It's the script you're given. But what do you bring to it? The only thing you can bring to it, there is only one thing that is going to make a difference and that's the relationship of the Color to that line. Because we know that if the relationship of the Color to the line is correct, everything else from beneath is going to move through.So it's this relationship between the Color and the line. When you're dealing with homogenized society, they're all doing the script the same way. They're all doing the lines the same way. There is no life there. When I began as a professional doing readings, it was an amazing thing for me after all, I wasn't into any of this kind of stuff that I could just read people. It was even more amazing that they saw themselves. This was the beginning of a process. But I noticed something right away. I noticed that the vast majority of the people I worked with, their particular activations always carried the same flavor. For me, this is really what the 4 does. It brings a certain flavor.

### The 4 Brings a Certain Flavor

We can begin to examine it. We can begin to go deeply into the way 4s operate at the Color level in terms of the Cross of Life, both the Design and the Personality level, internal/external, the Variable configuration of it, because what you're really seeing is the way everybody is being controlled in that way in which their script is being performed. They're not bringing their unique cognitive creativity to that expression. They're not. Those kinds of people who pretend to be something in order to act something, they're not. They don't have it because what makes the great performance a great performance is that you don't think of it as a performance at all. You fall for it hook, line and sinker. It's a living thing.

I had a fabulous example the other day, and I **do** recommend this film. It's called _Mongool._ It was actually made in the Mongolian language by a well-know Soviet film director, Sergei Bodrov. A number of years ago I think it was nominated one of those Best Foreign Film categories, that kind of thing. It is a sub-titled film. It was gorgeous. It's the story of the youth of Genghis Khan, Temujin. It was beautifully, beautifully done. It's spectacular film.

The themes that were there were alive, these themes that are archetypal, that are the way in which you control society, all of these things, all of them were emerging. You could see them. It was all about this. And one of fascinating things in watching this is that I didn't need to look at the subtitles. I saw them anyway, if you know what I mean. I was so taken in by the magic of the performance, what certain creative beings can do when they fully embrace a role. I love the metaphor. I do, truly, love the metaphor. This is what life is about.

The thing is that we don't have to develop acting skills, because that's not the point. The point is that we need to liberate the inspiration that is going to bring those lines alive, that's going to fill them with their differentiated potential because that's what it's all about. Then you get the performance. This is the thing about people and their crosses. I have a thing about crosses, I really do. There are mornings I wake up and say, I shouldn't have told them. Crosses, whoa, yeah, I know they're interesting. I know all of that. But what it is to be on that cross is that you have to have been able to find the spirit of your lines. This is what it means to differentiate, to express as a character outer authority, the beauty of what's possible in that.

What a journey it is to get there. And to see that we are always handicapped by the phenomena that gives us existence, this 4. Everything else is beholded to it, and in most cases, trapped by it. So there is this deadness in the way in which the drama of the lines is lived out. There is a banality to it that is purely this and that, the leftness and the right-ness of the transformative 4s, because that's what it is. And this becomes the "this and that" of the mundane homogenized world, everything caught in that balance sheet.

They're not interested in anything else. It isn't to say those beings who have this Color and that Color--remember I told you not to jump to conclusions--it doesn't mean that that's the thing. We studied all that, we know how that works. What I'm showing you here, the reference I gave, is to think about this in the same way that you would think about the background global frequency. It all comes out of this. It's there.

### The Wave of the 4: Kindness/Mearness

Recognize something deeper than that, the wave of the 4. Have you ever thought about the wave of the 4? In one of my _Mechanics of the Maia_ TV shows coming up, I'm going to do the wave mechanics, the wave mechanics beyond the emotional system, the wave mechanics that are there in the way lines operate. The wave mechanic of the 4th line is kindness/meanness. I want you to think about the way in which 4s lay out a foundation for a background frequency for homogenized humanity.

Their "this and that" is kindness/meanness. This is the polarity. They don't have any authority. And this is the externalizing force. They don't have any unique authority, they don't have authority that they can stand on and resist the power of this. And by the way, obviously, it is something different if you're somebody who has the 4 Color, wherever it may be in your Variable construct; obviously you're intended to align to the power of this.

But again, you're here to live that out in a cognitive way, not to live that out with the distortion that transference brings. Nobody is getting the correct cognitive feed when they're in transference. So the way that 4 operates at that dumbed-down level is very different than what its actual potential is. But it's that dumbed-down level that dominates and it's that dumbed-down level that is the source. It's funny about things.

### The DreamRave

Something I discussed in my advanced DreamRave program, something that fascinates me, is when you look at the DreamRave you're looking at a five-centered creature. So we have an evolutionary process in which we move from the five-centered mammalian root and never fully left it. We were five-centered when we would sleep and for hundreds of thousands of years we were seven-centered when we woke up. We are five-centered when we sleep, and we are nine-centered now when we wake up. The evolution is in the waking rave. We are still deeply primitive and one third of our life is lived out in a lunar body that is deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply primitive.

So much of what we are is deeply primitive. It is something to understand the way in which the homogenized masses are controlled. After all, all of you have taken enough programs in Human Design to have seen so many different ways in which conditioning is at work. And yet, to see that there are these broad homogenizing systems that are built into it. The homogenizing had to come from somewhere. I hate to point fingers, but you know.

### Without the 4 There is No Frequency for the Monopole to Capture

Without the 4 there is no frequency for the Monopole to capture. What to do. It is the tradeoff. It is an interesting thing to consider, isn't it? The world is controlled by a very, very limited frequency. This is how the not-self operates. It's controlled by this very, very limited frequency, this background frequency.

Think about what Color does. Color is the instrument of information that dictates whether you are going to eat properly, live properly, see properly and be aware. It's all in the hands of Color. And in the distortion through the dominance of the 4, you can see what that's going to do, the limitation that it locks humanity into, not gaining access to the cognition and at the same time being given a very, very limited palette in ways they can express the potential of the line that is there.

### Living Your Lines

Ah, the beauty of living your lines. I always remember people saying to me that they didn't like their detriments and I would look at them like they were just simply nuts. No line means anything until it's lived. And it's only in the way that it is lived that its value and essence emerge. I don't think there are too many people on this planet who truly understand the Rave I'Ching. The Rave I'Ching is not a text. Itisn't. It was. I guess you could call it, automatic writing or whatever these funny names are because I had no references or anything. I just sat down and wrote it over a period of 28 days.

It is poetry. It's not detail in that sense. I think so many people get lost in trying to figure out what a line means rather than living the line. To live it, and to live it in the sense that you're not doing anything, you're observing out of your awareness because you can understand the mechanic within yourself, because you are able to recognize that mechanic at work. This is what everything about awareness is all about. It's not about what the line is. There are a zillion people who are going to have that line. It's not about that. It's everything that's underneath. It is the orientation and it's the sensory system. It's all these things that are there. It's the magic of the depth that's possible for us as nine-centered beings.

It's not like the 4 is to blame, even though I love to point a finger at it; it's not. It's just the way these things work. But the way they work obviously have a deep, deep impact. The thing is about how you escape in the end, and what you can learn from it. When I first began my mystical process before my encounter, I was rather wild and strange. There were people who liked to label me a black magician, whatever that meant to them, these terms that people like to bandy about.

If you really understand the 4, you understand how all human beings can be basically manipulated. That's quite spooky when you think about it, because they can all be manipulated to the mean. And that mean is established through the 4-ness whether it is left or right. You can always move them by using those instruments, because that's what they're used to. It's the way their whole existence is framed. It is the great limitation of what it is to be homogenized. It's not simply that one does not have access to the cognitive architecture and all those things that are underneath, the fact is you have an incarnation in which you are damned to being furniture, and nothing to be done about it.

### The Journey Demands Much of the Individual

When you look out, as I do, at the way the global movie plays out, what you see so clearly is that the whole world is trapped by the homogenized drive towards the edge. And it is not in the interest of the program to release humanity from the thrall of fear; it is not, not at all. It has worked perfectly so far. I finally have a place where I can sort of begin to draw a line. I'm beginning to see certain things about what's possible for people in Human Design. I've always understood that if the basic elements of the knowledge, Strategy and Authority, were embraced that that, in and of itself, is a great service and it is something that will always be appreciated.

But more and more I see there is a journey here and a journey that demands so much of the individual. It is something that is obvious to me, that in order for anyone to truly break free, you have to break free at each of the points of your Variable. We're going to have some nice Variable moments in our journey. Variable is everything. When you finally get to the place where you want to see how everything is organized you go to the top, you see the Variable. If you want to see what makes it possible for the Variable to be distorted, you go to the 4 because this is where you're going to see it.

It means one of the things that needs to be seen in order for anyone to be able to move through this process in terms of what is possible mechanically or what mechanically is pointed to, is that each of those points in the transformation process, each of those four transformation processes, literally, has to be embraced at as deep a level as it possibly can. There really isn't any other way. There isn't. It's obvious to me.

I see the Program. The Program is so explicit. The Program says this is the way it works. If you're a nine-centered being, you're raised correctly, you have your PHS, you're raised according to your type, when you're 30 you find your environment, by the time you're 50 you have honed your perspective, and post-50 you have your opportunity for the expression of your outer authority. That's the formula. Not ours. It's the formula for babies now who are lucky enough to have parents who are ready for that commitment, for them and for themselves, but not us. That movement between what is environmentally correct and the development and the honing of the perspective takes 20 years.

### Standing Alone is Very Courageous

If you're fully going to walk this road so the expression that is there in the way that line emerges is truly unique, it is quite a journey. And one you have to take alone. I'm not a group person. I don't like masters, in that sense, the guru version of it, these kinds of things. I don't like dependency. It's so obvious to me that dependency is a disease, it's a sickness. It's very difficult to stand alone. It's the most courageous thing you can do. There isn't anything that is more courageous, everything else by comparison, no. To stand alone, to stand within your own authority, this is not something that you look around and you see everywhere.

This is sheep planet. Everybody homogenized; the brotherhood/sisterhood of humanity, the 4 theme--let's all be brothers and sisters. I don't want to be brothers and sisters with everybody. I don't. It's not who I am. Just because people think that's a nice theme is because they've been deeply conditioned to 4-ness, and 4ness is everywhere, after all, everywhere. Ah, what it means to be able to do this alone, what it takes.

You know your own lives. You know what it's like. You came somewhere in the middle of it, got all that stuff behind you, got all that stuff that's still with you. You have all that stuff that's controlling where you're going. It's human beings, after all, human beings lives, not-self lives, wow, the tangled webs. And then to truly transform your life you have to be ready to embrace what, in fact, may be very difficult for those around you and those that you're connected to and all of the social consequences that come with being yourself. Enlightened selfishness, what it takes to be selfish, what it takes to be able to stand up to all that.

### Two Ways to Live Life

It doesn't matter what you are, whether you're a 4, as an example, or whatever. It comes back to something very basic in this knowledge. There are two ways to go. One way is you take Strategy and Authority into your life and you just go through your life. You go through a natural seven-year deconditioning process and you let your life take you where it takes you. It doesn't mean you have to go any further. For most human beings that would be an enormous reward in and of itself, and it is.

But there is another way. But this way is the way of the elite. It's a deeply, deeply personal process. It doesn't mean you can't have beings in your life. But it does mean that life has to be on your terms, not anybody else's; what to do. If you do not look after yourself, nothing will. If you do not take control, nothing will. Nobody is going to do it for you. Nobody can take you by the hand and pull you through this, you know that. You can educate people as best you can, you can share with others as genuinely as you can. But it doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean anything in the sense that it doesn't guarantee anything. It doesn't mean that that's what it's going to be for them, that it's going to work, that it's going to click.

### The Consequences of Seeking Differentiation are All Social

How rare it is, how beautiful it is to have this opportunity. I was mentioning yesterday in my PHS and Rave Psychology third year programs that the consequences of seeking differentiation are all social. To make decisions in a way that is not generally understood or recognized, to demand your own space, and to sleep in your own bed already creates an enormous difference in the way you operate in your relationship to others. And then to eat according to what is correct for you.

The two great bonds of social interaction--food and sex--get highly disturbed by sleeping in your own bed and eating according to your dietary regimen. Sharing the bed and sharing the table, these are fundamental social elements in the way in which the bargain has been construed between the male and the female, as an example. The moment you begin to break down these particular controls, you're going to meet resistance. It takes strength to be able to establish your own unique life. And you establish that through your dietary regimen, and beyond your dietary regimen to the environment that is correct for you, which is the final, in that sense, socializing phenomena in that you may really belong someplace else as far as that's concerned.

You can't do any of this. You can't get to the awareness until you do a full-time job on everything because we are the ones who are deconditioned. And for us, there is no luxury of things unfolding as they should. There is the headlong embrace in order to correct as quickly as we can the dysfunctions that are there within our system. But I want you to be able to see what the 4 brings. It is quite something to understand it and to begin to reflect on it. To begin to reflect on the way in which it is an underlying theme that permeates everything so that everything can always come back to something.

The thing that makes the Monopole so interesting, that attraction, it only attracts, the capture frequency, this pulling in, this taking in, it is here that it makes it all possible. I assume that it has to do with the way in which something in the nature of the facet--not something that I was told, so I don't know--this quality that is there that the Monopole recognizes, this quality that is inherent in all of these other aspects.

### Look at Your 4s

But it leaves you with something truly to ponder. That is, look at all those elements of 4-ness. The other thing is, look at your own 4s, particularly if they're either Sun/Earth or nodal and understand that that's a challenge in that it's very easy to get pulled into the mainstream and you have to be quite vigilant. But it's something to ponder.

Well, I'm not used to doing 90 minutes. I kept on wondering what time it was. That's an interesting experience. We'll start off here. I'll see where I go; I'll wait until tomorrow to sort of figure out where I'm going to take you in our ongoing adventures. But I'm certainly glad to see all of you; it's nice to see all of you back in the classroom, particularly at this level. I think we're going to have an interesting time. Anyway, to all of you, keep those 4s in mind and enjoy that. Until next time, Dye for now.

 

## 11 The Four-ness of the Future

### The 4 Controls the Way in which the Frequency is Released

Welcome to all of you. This is really an incredible subject. It is the last day that I will spend with it, at least this time around. But it is one that is really deserving of a lot of thought, the nature of the way in which the 4 operates. Let me give it to you in a context that is really different. Let's look at it in the evolutionary context. In the evolutionary context, we have what we distinguish as a transition between the seven-centered and the nine-centered being that took place in 1781. The seven-centered being, according to this, is a left-oriented creature. Where we're going, theoretically, is to the eventuality of the rave which is an exclusively right-oriented creature, of which we nine-centered beings are the transitional form that takes this movement from one side to the other.



 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

that's just next to it, that is a measurement that is so tiny that most human beings are incapable of thinking of something that small. So, please don't think that it's suddenly going to be 89 or 87.

Is it arcane? I don't know what you call this kind of thing. It's one of those odd pieces of information I have that allows me, because I'm always looking for the mechanical solution, to really be able to see and understand why the 4--it's ok that the 4 is responsible for that, that's easy to understand--but why there is the shift. And the shifting of the reception is something that is really quite remarkable, because I think that is tied to much larger cycles that, in essence, is the closest I've come in the star work that I did in Rave Cosmology. This angle, the way the angle works is very much connected to the way in which the star field moves. But that's really a--yeah, we have a lot of time in these classes, but still that would be a long way to go, so I'm not going to go there. Maybe one day, Deborah, you go there.

### The 4 Holds the Mystery of the Evolution of Cognition

Everything about the 4 is that it holds the mystery of the evolution of cognition, because it is expressive instrument. Let me take you away from this illustration for a second. Let's think about Tone. When we think about Tone we know that 4 equals Right; we know that. The moment we understand that 4 equals Right, we have to see something about the inherent evolutionary trajectory of an expression system that is rooted in 4-ness, is that it leads here. Speaking of Obama--this is where it goes, this is where it came from. And we know that there was a cycle before. We know that this is an ongoing process. And what we know is that it's here. But what is very, very significant to us now is that it's going here because it gives us a deep insight.

Let's go back for a second. I've mentioned a few times; I always mention it when I'm dealing with thinks like the WA or dealing with any kind of transpersonal aura because I

\begin{tabular}{l l something. Look inside this red box. What you're looking at is, in essence, a description of the world to come. That is, the rare world to come. And if you look at the other side of it, you will see our history and where we came from. Now, I'm not going to get into that today.

## Appendix A Rave History Course

By the way, I have to share it with you. I have been inspired by many of Adrian's statistics and I'm particularly interested in evolution. Evolution is one of those things that fascinate me. I think more than anything else I feel privileged to be able to see the mechanism unfold over time and be conscious of it while I'm in the middle of it. I'm going to give a rare history course next semester. It's going to be based on looking at all of the nodal cycles between 1781 and 2027. It's fascinating. It's just fascinating to see the magic, the beauty and the complexity of the Program, the way in which incarnation is manipulated by the Program, the way fundamental themes are manipulated by the Program.

But anyway, I don't want to get into any long digression. I want to get back to this box here, because what you're looking at here is 4-ness. You're looking at 4-ness at many levels, obviously. There is a line level that slips in there. There are also expressions of right-ness that are there, clear expressions of right-ness that are there. Four-ness carries many levels to it.

But I want you to think about this not in the sense of what it is to be us, but what it will be for those nine-centered mutations who arrive with only right-ness who are designed to live only right-ness, and the description is here. It's really something to see.

## Appendix B The High Ground is Very Important for the Rave

The first thing that I found fascinating is thinking about it in this. In my own private thoughts, my musings, when I was doing that whole Rave Cosmology on the rave, basically how the consciousness Penta works, because the human element is really negligible, in that sense. I guess that's what bothers me about it. It is the Penta that rules. It was clear to me that--I don't know, I kept seeing them on the high ground. It's so interesting just to see it in that way.

In other words, I think that the high ground is very much where they will go to and quite literally, in that sense. I think that oxygen reduction is something that is going to be very, very important for them. It's just interesting. Not only oxygen reduction, but obviously it's cooler up there the higher you go. It's just interesting to think about environmentally where it's pointed, where that it goes.

### Nervous Eating

They are going to be opportunists who are going to be ready and able to wait. The part that is the sacrificial lamb, what the rave is, giving of themselves, always sacrificing of themselves. Yet, thinking about the 4s of wanting and need--doesn't that look funny in there. It's like if you were looking at the left side, you would see calm in that position. Does it look funny to you? It says so much about these creatures, that eating will be something that is deeply agitating for them.

Of course, it's understandable if you're dealing with a right passive form that the nervousness is absolutely essential because you have to get something going in order to be able to break down the various things that are coming into the system in order to be able to provide the particular nutrition. But it's just so interesting in all this right-ness and the passivity in the mediation, in the inner vision and the receptivity, there is this nervous. We know what it's related to. But it also says something about the kind of systems these creatures are going to have, the dilemma they're going to have with trying to find a way to crank themselves up in order to be able to handle their food processing.

### The Heating-Up Process Since 1781

It's all in the 4. It is the thing that I find wherever you look that there is always a mechanism; there is always one of these keys. There is always one of these things that turn. If you think about the movement of the angle of the crystal as an evolutionary signal, the moment we entered into the nine-centered vehicle the macrocosmic expression of that was heat. Perhaps the most incredible thing that has taken place since 1781 is heat. You can't imagine that, if you know what I mean. That is, we don't think that way.We think of the world this way. We think about heating systems, all of these things. But the world is starting to warm up. In the late 1700s it really started to warm up. Oh yes, it started at the beginning of the Cross of Planning, the early roots of Industrialization, but like all things, it takes time to build that momentum. By the way, when you get to 1781 you have this enormous burst in heat, all the factories, all the mines, digging out coal, burning in all the houses in the Northern Hemisphere--the heat, more and more heat. And with more and more heat, more and more people, more and more heat.

I find it so amusing that they blame global warming on us. I do. The ozone layer, the atmosphere is where the problem of global warming is. It's about methane. But if you think about the methane problem, 20% of the methane problem comes from the gas of cows. I don't see anybody running around saying let's ban all cows, because if you did you would have the greatest reduction in methane in the atmosphere going back a long time. It's all part of a heating-up process. It's absolutely essential. All of it is essential. Otherwise, you don't have mutation. Otherwise, you don't just have it.

It's the one thing that I would love to have, because it would be one of those great ways scientifically of pointing to 1781, aside from the discovery of Uranus, and say, if you look at the temperatures of human beings going back the last 50 years and you look at the temperatures of children being born over the next 50 years from 1781, you'll notice that they're hotter. It's the most important thing that has happened to us.

The by-product of the heat is increased mutative potential, all of which is focused on what we refer to the histidine codon. This is the key to releasing all of this mutative pressure that has been building up so that we can get here. It's interesting to think about the 4 because in a sense, the 4 is in charge of whether or not any of this can exist because it's pushing everything like this. And what I mean by that is that the homogenized world is moving this way whether they know it or not.

### The Culmination of the 4 in its Cycle

Think about what I just said. The homogenized world is moving towards this, whether they like it or not. And this isn't about that it happens to be the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix and we're moving away from the 40/37 and we're trading it in for the 20/34 and so forth. Yes, we're well aware of those elements. But this is something else. This is the culmination of the 4 in its cycle.

What's happening is that moment by moment we are moving away from the ability of those being born to have left-ness, that is, the rare mutations, in order for rare mutations to come in, in order for these rave children to be born they cannot display left-ness. That means that the switch is already in, if you know what I mean. It's already there. It's already set up.

And it means that the support mechanism for that, the cognitive process, has shifted from the left-ness of it to the right-ness. And in shifting to the right-ness it's basically going to its pure 4-ness, because that pure 4-ness is an element that is going to be carried in the 1 and the 2 and the 3 and the 5 and in the 6, because otherwise it cannot be recognized and captured by the Monopole.

So, regardless of whether you're coming in with this, the background of it all, the way in which this is working in terms of the way the crystal is working, is that everything is being pressured to the 4. It gets harder and harder and harder. It doesn't get easier as we move forward. It doesn't get easier for those who are ignorant to find a way out. It is not going to get easier.

### The Return to Eden

Think about this last nodal cycle. This is a very, very special time. For many, many years the Ibiza Event--this will be the seventh year coming up, and before that I did four or five years of them--its poetic name was always Return to Eden. It was a nice pun on the beauty of the island, I suppose, and the fact that this is where the knowledge came into existence. But this Return to Eden is not about that directly. It's about the fact that we are in the time of the 61.1 in the precession of the equinox. This is the key to the lock of secrets.The 61.1 is Occult Knowledge. It is the foundation of the deepest of knowing. And it is this foundation of knowing, this 61.1 time which began at the beginning of the 1960s, is that this era we're in now, and now in this final nodal cycle, this is Eden. But not in the way you ever imagined. It's so different when a door opens and when a door closes. If we're just going to think about it in mythological terms, if you think about Eden you have the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. You eat from the Tree of Knowledge. It's a hard trip because you start off with just one fruit, not the root.

For the Tree of Life you have to go out and do your duty, you have to go out and multiply. So in a sense, when the door opens, Eden says: Go forth and multiply, gain knowledge, go forth and multiply. Now, I personally am a door closer. I think that's what "Hu" actually means, something like that anyway. Here we are at the Eden return. We really are. We are in the Eden return. This is the last time the secrets, the inner truths can be revealed. It's been going on since the beginning of the '60s, and we're all witness to the enormous of inner truth that has been revealed, form knowledge that has been revealed.

### The Door is Closing

But the door is going to close in 2027 and that key is going to go away. And it is not going to come back. It will be replaced by ambition. It will have nothing to do with truth, and when the door closes, the mantra changes. It says you've had your chance at all the knowledge, witness those of you who are here. Well, now is the time that it gets lost. And don't worry about multiplying; you won't. You won't at all. Lose the knowledge and disappear. That's what happens when the door to Eden closes.

Obviously, it doesn't take place overnight and this isn't some kind of sad tale. It's just about understating that these kinds of things have happened over and over and over again. They're cycles. It says something very profound about this time and the need to embrace this knowledge so deeply. To understand what it means that these 18 years we have left are years where the background frequency supports the truth; literally, it supports the truth.

How funny that's going to be when it's gone, isn't it? When it isn't in anybody's interest to care about the truth. By the way, humanity lived through many cycles in which the truth wasn't the point. They lived believing in all kinds of nonsense and never in any way fought against it. It's so easy to homogenize the sheep.

What a thing it is to understand that this door is closing. What it says about the pressure that is here is to make sure the foundation is established, the one-person-at-a-time foundation. It's very nice that there is an organized Human Design community and all of these things. We'll see how long in this way it lasts past 2027.

### We are the Library

Everything about the future is about one being at a time. There is no other way. And it means that those of us who are part of this time who are part of this closing cycle, we have a responsibility to the future to carry knowledge within us, because we are the library. There will be no other such other generations. We are the library. We are the liquidity. We are the potential depth for humanity in the future, and not all of us.

On Thursday _[Nov. 6, 2008]_ in Jovian TV I have a Clarion's alert for Projectors. It is so much connected to this. Everything about being a Projector is that you master the world through systems. And systems have been a by-product of this cycle. Not only that, but the by-product of this cycle has been the institutions that were established in order to be able to produce the system-knowers. Everything about being a Projector is about the development of systemic knowledge, which is supported by institutions that are disappearing these years now.

What it means for those of you who are Personality receptive, this is an enormous responsibility for you to pay attention, just take things in. Take it in and take it in and take it in and take it in, because the time will come when it will be needed. We are not moving towards a strategic future. We're not. That's not what's in the cards. It creates and will create a tremendous amount of helplessness. Remember that everything about the frequency, everything about the way in which everything is moving is for the benefit of something that hasn't come yet, that is here to replace us. And that we and our kind, even though our kind will begin to diminish, we're going to have to live on this plane and we're going to have to live on this plane with a background frequency that does not support us. It supports what's coming, what's arising. And so it should be. It's not like it's the villain or anything.

### The Turning of the Wheel

It's the beauty of the turning of the wheel. This is the turning of the wheel. It's what I meant when I said before that for me the great privilege is to be aware in an evolutionary process. I'm right in the middle of watching the wheel turn and I can smell it everywhere. It's incredible. It just is. The ugly part, the tragedy, is that for the homogenized being moving forward is going to get very difficult.

Oh, I don't think--well, I've said it enough. The 40/37 has been supporting us for 400 years. Can you possibly get that? Four hundred years; the same frequency--family, bargain, community, schools, cities, police, banks, on and on and on, one frequency consistent decade after decade after decade after decade, century after century. It's going away in 18 years. Now, that's really something. It's just going to go whoosh.

You can't know. I understand that. You can't know what it's going to feel like when it's not there, but oh boy are you going to feel it and you're going to see it everywhere. You're going to see it most in the homogenized voice; the great homogenized voice is the political voice of any group, culture, and nation. You'll see interests change. The thing you're going to see the most is, I guess the best way to describe that is, 'why should I help you when I have my own to look after,' sort of, something like that.

What happens when there is no more 40/37--Beethoven (Ra singing)--40/37 music. It's going to go poof, just like that. That's the thing that's so incredible. I hope, I truly do, that on the Ides of February 2027, that I'm alive because I want to feel it, because it's the kind of thing that you only get to feel once every 400 years or so. Wow. Like the great landscape that is the illusion behind everything, suddenly the scene is changed. Sorry. Were you used to all of that? Well, get used to this now. Oh how cruel it is when the wheel turns.

### The Trans-Auric Aura

The various levels that I am teaching this year, one of the things that's very fascinating is the teaching of WA. What you get to see in the larger trans-auric form is how everything is so deeply, deeply controlled and pointed in a specific direction, how everyone is locked in to a hierarchical construct that isn't something that is simply on the surface, but is there in your cells. Most of humanity will blindly go forward thinking that the future is moving to their benefit. We have been thinking that things are going to get better for 400 years, because that's the bargain, it's built into it.

We had the benefit of the 9 and the 16 in the background frequency, the detail, the focus, the talent, and the potential for it, all of that in service of the demands of an expanding community and population. It is the 40/37 that allowed us to be able to support the vast expansion of population in a planet because it provided the underlying organizational background to be able to link us all together into communities and bring functionality to that. The hierarchies that became our cities and states and countries, it's all Cross of Planning, all of it.

What you get to see in global cycles, what you get to see in the trans-auric aura is so many things we assume are ours don't belong to us at all, but are imposed on us by constructs we have no control over whatsoever. Oh, it is something to be able to stick your head through the sky and see the mechanism. And you see that we are moving towards a new Dark Age; they're going to be turning out the lights slowly but surely.

It's not like the last one. It's always different. This one is so deep. Where do you go after you leave truth behind? For those who are coming, they will not care. They will be born as Right beings in a Right-oriented world with a future in front of them, and the embrace of a background frequency that suits them just fine, thank you very much.

And the humans, us, as we keep coming in in diminished numbers, as we begin to collapse--oh yeah, it's not going to happen overnight. No it won't. And there isn't enough time for it to collapse completely. There will be humans here to the end and plenty of them. But, oh, how they will suffer if they are not aware, if they are not equipped. And there will be no institutions to support them. There will be no services available. We're dealing with a shift that is so profound.

### The Potential of Cognition

I look at the cycles. I've looked at the cycles over huge spans of time and everything is conditioned by the fact that the way in which the cycle is going to impact in the quantum of things is relative to the development of the cognition in its time. We are at an extraordinary place in the development of the potential of cognition, a place in which, with the mechanical information we have, it is possible for a human being who is born to conditioning to be freed of that and find awareness in this life.

We have enormous potential that is there for us. But you have to see something about this. It is the antithesis. It is so heretical to what is actually going on. But there is a glory in the binary, in the spectrum. Oh, there has to be room for everything. There is always room for everything. As the lemmings go over the cliff you can stand to the side. You don't have to go along for the ride, you don't, but you have to know how. Who is going to teach you? Who is going to teach the children? Where are they going to be taught? How long do you think any of these institutions are going to survive?

My guess is at the most 100 years, at the most, and many of them only in certain places. They cannot survive without the background frequency. Human beings are nasty lot; they're not aware. They're a nasty lot. They're killer monkeys. You take away a background frequency that says we're all brothers, family, blah, blah, blah. The reality is going to start sinking in about how much pressure there is in these coming years, these 18 years of this final nodal cycle.

### Be Ready to Help Someone Else

What it means, how much pressure there is. And to understand that the only preparation you can do is transform your life, because after all, this is about enlightened selfishness. You transform your life. You do the best you can to be ready to help someone else. To be able to be available for that other who is going to be there on your fractal, and to be equipped.

I think it's one of the most important things for us to recognize is that it's not just a matter of turning people on to Human Design so they can begin to make decisions correctly. It's about understanding that the more people we can educate, the better we can educate people, not just in the professional sense, but in the general education sense. The more knowledge that is taken in, the more there will be carriers of the knowledge into the future, the more the possibility of being able to cover the fractal requirements of those who are going to be in need.And most important of all, everything that's on this side is dealing with the right/receptive. This is what it's about. Everything is moving in this direction. But the advantage for us is that this is also the greatest resource that we can have.

### The Rave Children

Sometime after 2027, I don't know where and I don't know how many at first, I don't know how quick this process will go that a child is going to be born and the moment that child is born the doctor is going to shake his head and the nurse is going to sigh. Because the moment that child is born, it's going to be obvious that there is something "wrong" with it.

When I say something "wrong" with it, that "wrong" is in quotation marks. One of the obvious things about the rave child is that they are going to have qualities we associate with extreme autism. They will have poor vision; all kinds of things. And it is going to appear that, obviously, there is something that is deeply, deeply wrong with these children.

Now of course, if you put three of them in auric contact with each other, you will discover something that is really quite amazing. You will discover a living powerful entity. Now, everything about the nature of the rave is they are not here to have a unique identity--the movement--they're not here to have a unique identity.

Everything about the movement of the Left, until it gets to this point, is about establishing the unique identity. Everything about it; get to that unique identity. This is what we are doing. This is the completion of our process, that completion of our process so that we can express what we call it, the unique inner authority that establishes our uniqueness, our potential to differentiate. This is what we're here for. This is not what the future is about. The future is about giving up identity. Not simply giving it up, but not being born to even hold on to it; pure receptive.

### The Nature of Penta

All right, let's think about something, those of you who are not familiar with it. Let's think about the nature of Penta. Penta is the foundation trans-auric form. All life is organized through Pentas; we are all born into Pentas. This is the way life works. A Penta emerges--it's a trans-auric form, it's morphous--when there are three auras, four auras or five. That's the moment you have a Penta emerge. Pentas, as anyone who has studied Family Practice or those who have taken BG5 know, the moment you enter into a Penta certain fundamental rules about the way in which you're going to operate are conditioned by the way in which the form operates, the trans-auric form, the Penta itself.

Now, of course, one of the things about being us is that we have no conscious access to the Penta. In other words, we don't have a sense of this thing at a cognitive level manipulating us. We get it through inference in the same way that a scientist can measure something by the effect that it has. Anyone who has studied Family Practice or BG5 who puts it into application, that is, looks at the PentaGraph and describes what they see to the family or the group or whatever, Io and behold what you have is exactly the way in which that works.

This is the way in which we are controlled. But we're not connected to it. We're just manipulated by it, all of us. And of course, you go in and out of them all of the time. Or you live in them; most people do.

### The Conscious Penta

But the rave is different. This is a conscious Penta. In fact, the future is not about a change in us as a species as much as it's the emergence of the first trans-auric species, in a sense. The thing that's really the creature is the Penta itself. This is going to be a conscious Penta. What that means is that the Penta is going to organize the cognitive information that it has access to through those members of that particular Penta.

In other words, take the baby and right away there's a problem. I feel very sorry for the parents, blah, blah, blah, all that kind of stuff. And the baby gets shipped off to an institution. Now, there will be many places in the world where, I don't know whether the baby will even get that far the way in which it's going appear. But let's say you have three of them in an infant ward, all of sudden something emerges. What emerges is a conscious Penta. And that conscious Penta is going to take advantage of all the cognitive qualities and a lot of other things that are there, and it's going to be able to act them out through the gifts that are there.

Remember, all of you have been through tonal studies. And of course, you know that the moment you get to the 4th and the 5th and the 6th Tone you're getting into deep mystery land. You're getting into highly specialized gifts and qualities, all of which is going to not be the advantage of the individual rave, but a component that will be holistically integrated into the way in which the conscious Penta operates.

This is what I have a problem with. I have a problem with conscious Penta. It's a funny way to put all that. I'm not going to be one of them. I'm not going to produce them. I really don't have anything to do with it other than the fact that the knowledge was given to me. It's just part of the package I was given, so I deliver it as part of the package. But this is not something that I am enthusiastically looking forward to. This is just the wheel turning and nothing can do to stop this.

The moment I think of an entity that is going to give up of itself, I immediately get uncomfortable. That's not what I'm about. It's not what the knowledge was given to me for. It was given so that we have this possibility for this unique differentiated consciousness. It's such a beautiful thing. It's like the flower that blooms. We are the potential of the blooming flower and then it's just going to die.

How hard it will be to keep this spark alive. And most of humanity will just imitate the homogenized flow, lost in a frequency that no longer comforts them, guards them, supports them, because this is evolutions way of saying, _"See va, thank you, Dye Dye Dye now, thank you for being nice fertile Generators, what's there to replace you."_ And of course, there's nothing that can be done. This is just a wheel, it just turns.

### We Have a Responsibility

We have a responsibility to our own kind. We have a responsibility to our friends, our lovers, our children. We have a responsibility to prepare them, because whether they understand it or not, the rug is going to be pulled out from underneath them in 2027. It's not simply that we have been living with the same background frequency for 400 years. This frequency has been in our flesh and the flesh of our fathers and forefathers going all the way back those 400 years. It's been carried in the blood. It's carried deep, deep, deep within the marrow of our bones. It's been there for centuries.

What's coming is really something else. It's so different. I didn't come here to be some kind of spiritual guru. You all know that. It isn't my trip. I came here with a message of preparation: knowledge, prepare you, be ready, train your children, get them ready so that we, our kind, can flourish in the era that comes, because there's no reason not to. It makes no difference what the Program is when you operate out of your own authority. It makes no difference. It just changes the movie, that's all. And we live in the chaotic movie of the homogenized world anyway.

But it's about seeing that this time is so important. I thought about it from the very beginning of my process when I was first given the knowledge. I wondered if there was enough time. I had no idea if I could even get it out and I didn't know how long it would take before there would be enough people to create the critical mass necessary to keep it alive in the world and get it out there.

I still wonder about how much time we have. The longer I talk about it over the last several years, the more I realize that this shift that's coming, its impact is going to operate at so many levels. We can't afford to sort of slide towards that. There has to be a certain urgency, in that sense, to make sure that those who are ready can. And to make sure that those who are in this journey have the awareness and the ability to be able to deliver this.

## This is the Best Time to be Aware

I look at this and I can feel them. I don't look at this in the same way I would look at this if this was somebody who was Right and had these particular configurations, because obviously within a human context it carries a different quality. It's what makes us who we are, after all. We're perfection. That's what I keep on trying to explain to everybody. Mechanically we're at a perfect time. Again, this blooming, this blossoming is a perfect, perfect time. But it doesn't last. And everything about your particular process is about seeing this is the best of all possible times to be aware. There is no better time; there's none. But when you look at this box and you look at it in the context of a conscious Penta and you think about this conscious Penta and the way in which expect there is someone there to help you, that there will be someone there to guide you, that there will be someone there to protect you. We have built up all of these assumptions. They're not going to last. They can't.

### What We Don't Know by 2027 We'll Never Get to Know

And in these 18 years, I tell you something else. What we don't get to know, we will never get to know. That's something to really think about. All these people with their science fiction orientation about where things are going in the future and this and that, everything is going to get smaller, brighter, we're going to have this and that. Yeah, well, what we don't know by 2027, we're not going to know. The key is going to be taken out of the lock. We're not going to know.

It means there is incredible pressure now like never before. We're right in the middle of this process beginning with the '60s. Well, we're not in the middle, we're getting closer to the other side of that now, obviously. This tremendous pressure of getting all this knowing out, the explosion that has taken place since the beginning of the '60s. Think about it. How different the world is today from 1960, what is there today that wasn't there in 1960. It's unbelievable when you start thinking about it.

###All of the things that have been revealed since then, at a level--we have publications that reveal things every day at every single level that one can imagine. It's unbelievable the inner truth that is flowing on this plane. It's why we're here. We're here to take advantage of this time of perfection, this Return to Eden before the knowledge is lost, and before it's no longer just granted that it's there.

### Outer Authority

This is the beauty of inner authority into the future. If you carry inner authority with you, you carry outer authority. As you move into that future, your inner authority will guide you. It will eliminate the resistance. It will allow you to move and fulfill whatever it is your differentiation moves you towards. And those who you meet along the way will benefit from, can benefit from your outer authority because outer authority is something that is going to be sought after.

So many times I've talked about the fact that the future is about communication. Everything about the nature of our species is about the evolution of communication. The highest level of communication that we can achieve in our form is a verbal communication of pure outer authority. Obviously, the conscious Penta will communicate at a level we do not understand. It will literally be able to communicate through the electromagnetic field of the way in which the pentic aura operates. It's something else. It's something different.

We are the completion of a cruder version, in a sense, that we have to articulate it, we have to verbalize it, we have to be able to eat and push the air through the vocal cords to be able to express it. But nonetheless, outer authority is what is possible for us and this is what we're going to need.

If you look at my world in Rave Psychology when I point to outer authority, I point to the fact that this is the possibility of the expression of the filtering consciousness of the passenger. This is a very beautiful thing, outer authority. But it's not to be seen specifically in that context. There is a deep mundane value to true outer authority, a deep, deep, deep mundane value. To be able to deliver that outer authority to others, for us this is everything. This is what the future is all about.

What we're training is human beings who will display their unique authority. And because we understand the nature of fractals and because we know if you're operating correctly and moving correctly in your geometry, the forces that are there for you are going to be there. Then those opportunities for your outer authority to bring benefit to the other, well, they just do, they just happen. There isn't going to be, in the future that lies ahead--and again I'm not talking of the next 40 or 50 years, but beyond that--there isn't going to be the same kind of availability of resources, whatever those resources may be. There will be no communal maintenance of it.The State of Religion

I think one of the scariest things to think about, because it is scary, at least in my perspective, is what this marker will bring to the state of religion on this planet. I am not somebody who accepts any of the notions of the creation of the universe according to any particular religious philosophy. I'm into serendipity. If it can happen it will happen. But there are two things that are very interesting to look at. One is the 49 gate, which shares the histidine codon with the 55. The 49 gate is creating dysfunction in the 19/49.

Again, all of this is related because the 19/49 and the 40/37 are all part of the fundamental tribal stream. Not only are we losing the background frequency, but the fundamental needs of the tribe are no longer going to be answered and are no longer going to be answered by the head of the table, the head of the tribe. The principles are not going to be there. It's not going to be delivered. It isn't going anywhere. In other words, there is going to be a real breakdown.

Remember one of the things about the nature of religion and government: they both come from the same source. That is, they both come from the WA and they both come from hierarchical control of the masses. Now, hierarchical control of the masses has been made easy by the background frequency we have been experiencing, again, the Cross of Planning. It has made it easy to coordinate people to get them to work together, to get them to build things together, to get them to share together, all that kind of stuff.

So, we're looking at a two-fold thing. What we're looking at is not only is the basic needs--and one of those basic needs of the 19 is the need for God--that no longer can that be satisfied by the tribe because there will be dysfunction with the 49. Not only will the 40/37 which is the mystical bridge, that is, the 40/37 is the search God or not, search for the Godhead or not, whatever the case may be, the builder of churches and temples and so forth, all of that is in the 40/37. All of that is going away.

Which means that one of the things we have been witnessing that I have been talking about, I guess for about a decade now, is we're getting to see the unconscious reaction to the power of the communal process breaking down. Not only are we seeing the breakdown, as an example, in the financial plane in the world lately, not only do we see the breakdown at that level, but you can see that it's harder and harder to fill up a church. It's harder and harder to do certain things.

On the other side of that you have a tremendous reaction--fundamentalism--the world-wide fundamentalism in every religion trying to hold on to the communal power that comes with being able to control groups in that way. All of that has been supported by the Cross of Planning.

## Appendix A Deep Shattering is Coming

There is a deep shattering coming. We will sense it. We will watch this whole process, all of you. Anyone who has ever been a student of mine will get will to see this, and will get to see the wonder of what it is to actually be able to see all of this come to fruition because this is just the movement. And to know how to be ok, it's about knowing how to be ok in this life, isn't it?

One of the things that I return to, because everything today has a certain mystical quality to it, I return to something very basic, something that every time I think about it it sort of puts me into a sort of little reverie. The Design Crystal, the Personality Crystal, the Magnetic Monopole are not made of the same stuff as this world. They're not atomic. They have nothing to do with atomics. One of the things I remember moment-by-moment in my awareness is that I don't come from here. And I don't belong to any of this. And it is all deeply alien. And yet, at the same time, this is it. This is the movie. This is the only movie. This is the way that it goes.

One has to be so careful about being identified with this life. My role isn't to frighten you about the changing of the cycle and doomsdays and all that stuff, because it isn't. It really isn't. And most human beings won't notice for quite awhile to see anything has changed, because that's humanity. They're not very bright.

With mechanics we're looking at something so incredible, this evolutionary thing. It's a movement. It will take until the last child born before the Ides, the last child, when they die, the last one born before, when they're all gone, when all of the human beings that were born before 2027 are no longer on this plane, whoosh, then it's really over. We all carry this with us. We will carry into the next cycle. It's in our blood.

But those that are born afterwards, no. And those who survive into the next cycle, by the time they're gone, the frequency is gone. Those that carry the need for truth and the need for community are simply going to be gone. Something else will be there. And for those who are there that are born to it, it's not like they're going to think anything is missing, because they're not going to be interested because the key is out of the lock of looking for truth. It's about ambition. Purpose is going to look different.

Oh, we're entering into the age of the 20/34; busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, very busy, everyone being very busy in the now. No past, no future; that's not as comforting as the 37/40 in its emotional wave movement. Oh, how different. Those who are born to that will live it. And if they meet one of us along the way and you say to them, 'there used to be a time when,' what do they care? They won't. It's such a funny thing to see the turning.

## The 16 Variables

You all know that I'm going to be doing the 16 Variable workshops at the 2009 Ibiza Event. It is something that I'm very much looking forward to. I have three open motors so it is an experience that I will be able to take in physically at a very deep level. I have a feel for each of these things.

One of the keys in the future is that those of us who are going to be able to establish a consciousness field that is going to be of value to humanity are going to have to find our place in the order on our own. It's what your Variables is about. It is what education=PHS, Rave Psychology, the CHD, all of these things=is about. It's about building a foundation for a community of beings who are going to be able to take advantage of this last 18 years of the Cross of Planning to find an organization that is there to be able to help them find their way to transformation.

It's interesting, each of these 16 ways because they are ways. They are ways of transformation. It is about seeing clearly that the only way our kind is going to be able to flourish in the future is if we can master this. And not simply the mastering of it, because that literally is specifically related to those of us who are born conditioned. But to be able to prepare children for this so they don't have to go through a huge conditioning dilemma as they mature and enter into the next age.



 
## 



So this is where we got to when we began our little journey last week of me trying to give you a clean, simple way of understanding the phenomena of the 4. It takes us into strange ground, doesn't it? It takes us into the way the whole movie works, in a way. It leads us into this odd future where we get to see it. And we get to see it with a lot more drama because we can begin to imagine what it looks like even though our imagination compresses the phenomena that will arise. Everything moves at its own pace.

### Embrace the Knowledge as Deeply as You Can

But there is something to keep in mind in all of this--yourself. You're part of a very small coterie of beings who are deeply, deeply privileged. You have the karma, the interest, the intellectual capacity, and the money to be able to do such a thing, to be a part of such a level of awareness. You have to see that you cannot ignore what it's telling you. You have to embrace this as deeply as you can. It means you have to embrace it as deeply as you can relative to the transformations that are there, relative to your Variable, deeper and deeper and deeper so that the evidence is there.

Anyway, it's an interesting experience for me to teach these 90 minutes. I haven't done that in years. I found myself after 60 minutes going "Oh, this is not the end," which is very cute. So, I'm going to have to get used to this. But anyway, we'll be back tomorrow and I don't know what I'm going to do. I'll sleep on it. Think about it. But anyway, I hope you enjoyed that on the 4s. To all of you, you take care. Bye for now.

## 11 Lasson Three

### 11 Link Nodes and Variables

Hello and welcome to all of you. One of the things I cautioned you about was my approach to Advanced Mechanics. I simply go where my curiosity takes me and where I feel it has some fundamental value to set myself up to share it with you. There is a whole series of things that are deeply important to me in my own particular area of the way in which I look at things and what I am exploring now in my own process. This is the year of Variable for me. That is culminating in the 16 Variable Workshops in Iblaz in April 2009. So a lot of my thinking is related to Variable and to the way I can try to get a grasp of what fascinates me the most which is my participation in an evolutionary process consciously.

### 11 Seeing History through Incarnation

I'm particularly interested in incarnation. Incarnation is one of those things that, though I have certain formulas, I have never been able to properly assemble it in a way that I can do something I intend to do before my career is done. And that is to be able to prove scientifically the reality of reincarnation. It is one of those processes I have been looking into for about seven years now. I'm beginning to get to places where I'm beginning to understand the deep complexity of looking for that answer for me and at the same time, particularly the last several years, getting the kind of information that I can begin to put the pieces together.

I have an unusual mind in the sense that I don't get to work with it. Most of you know that about me by now. I don't; it's just all unconscious. So, this is where I work with my mind, in that sense. This is where things come out. Elements keep on emerging. I put together what I think is a delicious program for next semester. I'm going to do six different five-week courses. One of them is the beginning of something that I hope I will carry on for many years, something that I have always wanted to do and that is Rave History. I'm a history buff.

I'm somebody who, because of my memory gifts, know a great deal of history that is global rather than what most people are educated to, which is their provincial history, their country, whatever the case may be, unless they specialize later in other things. I've always been a globalist, in that sense. I'm always curious about when somebody would say something was happening in 1500 over here, I was always curious about what was happen in 1500 over there. I was always looking for the measurement.

Because I have a strong background in history, because of the whole thing that I have been through over these last two decades, I suddenly have a way of looking at history that is absolutely revolutionary. It's absolutely revolutionary to be able to see history through incarnation. This is something that is remarkable.

In other words, to be able to see history, not in terms of--how shall I put this--incarnation is something that deeply fascinates me. When people look at the Program every day I don't look at the Program so much as what's that's going to do to me, because frankly, I'm long past that whole process in my awareness. But there isn't a moment I look at that the Program that I don't feel--I think "feel" is the only word that I can use--the forces that are incarnating on this plane through that matrix, and variations of that matrix. In other words, it is this incarnating force.

For example, you take a transit that took place--I was talking about the Nodes. I don't know how long it was. I think it was short, fortunately. I think it was about 10 or 11 days, it may have even been shorter, but anyway, this was the transit of the Nodes in the 13.2 and the 7.2. It ended on this past Saturday _[November 1, 2008]_. The 13.2 is the line of Bigotry. The 7.2 is the Democrat. Now, of course, that can be very misleading. But think about the beings being born then.

You look at a transit and you say, "Oh, shit, look at that. Look at what's there today." But every time I see a transit that carries a powerful ingredient, I'm thinking oh my goodness there are going to be ten thousand, one hundred thousand, five hundred thousand, a million, it depends on the length of the transit, doesn't it? This is history. This is my perspective on history.

### The Program Sets Up All Circumstance through Incarnation

In other words, taking history and taking it out of synch--how can I express that? Most people look at a particular date, a historical date, a historical event and they analyze the event itself. Now, we've done that to death with whatever we've had available for analyzing. But I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in how the Program set it up. And the way that the Program sets up any event, any circumstance within the global context, obviously, within the evolutionary context, is that it sets it up through incarnation.

In other words, there are many ingredients involved and it's not going to be an exact science. For example, let's say that we're looking at what the Program wanted to be sacrificed in the First World War. You had the greatest man-made death toll. Unbelievable. So what did the Program want for that? Now, in order to be able to do that you have to have a number of things, obviously population statistics for that particular era and so forth. But the Program is always setting it up. And this is something that is really remarkable.

I'm going to show you something because I will get to our subject in a bit. Many of you know that I've been profoundly assisted in my analysis of these things by the statistical material that Adrian has been developing. Hopefully in the not too distant future we're going to publish these statistical analyses. I think you're going to find them fascinating, as I do. And obviously, they cover many different areas.

But again, my particular area of interest is incarnation. Now, I want to caution all of you--and Adrian, by the way, if you'd like to write in any background information that you think the rest should keep in mind while they're looking at this graphing, or if I make any errors in what I'm saying, please feel free to just write it in.

### The Variables (2008-2027) Graph

I got this today. First of all, just to set it up for you, you can see that all 16 Variable groupings are here. You can see, though, it's not easy to follow it, but nonetheless, you can see that each of them is color coded. And what you're looking at is a time scale that is from 2008, where we are, the last nodal cycle, going to 2027. In other words, you're looking at an 18 year period of incarnations. What you're looking at at the side is the percentage of population that any given Variable is going to have in the total population. In following the graphing you're able to see the fluctuations in the percentage of the population that each particular Variable represents.Now, the first caution in all of this is that I'm not here to make any kind of broad statement about all of this because we have a great deal of work to do in research. But again, I'm interested in incarnation because it is something that fascinates me. This is the way in which the whole Program is coordinated. So, what you're looking at here is the 16 different Variables and you're looking at the way in which they are incarnating.

Now, what is interesting in all of that is that if you look here at the Lefts, one of the things you begin to notice is that what we're going to have here is a crash of the left somewhere from 2026 to 2027. On the other side you have the Right and you have a rise of the right. Now not just simply the rise of the right, because this is rather complex in all of the graphing. But what you're looking at in terms of the forces that are going to be incarnating, and of course, again what we are really looking at, the 2027 figure, as you can see from Adrian's comment above that this is the segment that is just before the Ides, just before the actual transition. You can see there is this crash of the left and it means there is going to be a rise of the right. _[Adrian's comment: 2027 comprises only the time span from 1.1.2027 to 14.2.2027.]_

Now, by the way, this is not necessarily a continuing trend at all. It is interesting for our purposes. For me I find it personally, how shall I say this, I got very excited when I saw this image. I'm outer vision, so images for me are very important. Looking at this particular graphing the first thing that struck me was this tremendous movement of this birth pressure to move towards the right. There has to be a burst at the transition time. We're looking for a mutation. Not all the quad-rights who are going to be born--it's going to depend on their parents. It's going to particularly depend on the father. There are all of these mutative equations that are involved. And in order for mutation to be successful, you need to have that spread in the population in order to be able to take advantage of as many possibilities as you can.

## The DLL-PLL (1781-2027) Graph

I want to show you something else. It's interesting. This is 1781 to 2027. When you're looking at this, what is interesting for me, and again, it's not a trend that is going to stay, but at the same time there is a downward movement, particularly a downward movement since around the beginning of the First World War. There are a couple of spikes that you can see, but basically there is this drift in terms of the far lefts, obviously, that are coming into the world. Again, there is going to be obvious relative differences between the various Variable groupings. You can see that the birth rate hasn't been taken into consideration yet. We're looking at sketches, statistical sketches.



## The DRR-PRR (1781-2027) Graph

If we look at the next one, you can see that we're looking at the all Right. The interesting thing about the all right, first of all, is that it starts high, it stays high and it begins this general movement--it keeps to a general movement upwards basically. You can see there's a spike here that's going to take place sometime around 2010 to 2011. In other words, there is some interesting movement that is taking place.

### The Plutonic Interregnum

Remember; think about what you're looking at. You're looking at incarnating forces. And because you're looking at incarnating forces, not only are you looking at Variable, but you're looking at generational equations that are taking place. For example, the rave history that I'm beginning and working with Adrian in developing the material for Rave History, one of the things I'm fascinated by is the influence of Pluto. This is a Plutonic interregnum. In 1781 Pluto was in the 41st gate. In 2027, Pluto will be in the 41st gate. In other words, this is a Plutonic interregnum.One of the things that we're looking at is the influence of Pluto in specific gates during the different nodal cycles. One of the things I want to examine is, historically, all of the nodal cycles, including the characters that have emerged beginning with 1781 in order to begin to see for the first time how the Program works through bringing life.

One of the things that is so fascinating to me is this "bringing of life" that brings a unique programming with it. So one of the things that's fascinating--not just simply Pluto, obviously Pluto is a main ingredient. I don't think you can look at this particular era from 1781 to 2027 without seeing it through Pluto's eyes. For example, the progression of Pluto beginning in 1781, beginning in the 41st gate, this movement beginning in Aquarius and beginning to move around, every single gate that Pluto touched changed the nature of being, every gate. And in every gate what it did was truly Plutonic. It turned something off and it turned something on. This is the on-and-off switch of the transition.

Isn't it funny that humanity tried to slough off Pluto? It is to me. I find that so curious. Oh, the revenge of Pluto. Now, now, to call sweet Pluto a dwarf, you're playing with fire. This is the on/off switch. This is death and resurrection; our death and the rise of something else out of it. This is a deeply, deeply Plutonic era.

So, not only are we looking at the way in which incarnative forces arrived during a nodal cycle, but during that cycle what is the Plutonic instruments at work. And then you begin to see. I don't know if that is deeply appealing to others. It is a fascination for me. The most incredible thing that the knowledge has given is a way to be able to look at life in the flow of time to truly be able to see it. This is something that is really remarkable.

Once I can see clearly how the Program prepares for each major event in what we call a historical continuum, I can do what the gift of logic provides. That is, begin to postulate the pattern for the future. What I'm looking for is the identity tags, the tags for the raves. I'm looking for certain things. One of the graphs--it's not here because I don't want to get lost in all of this, I do want to look at Link Nodes--but one of the graphs today that was really remarkable was looking at all of the Variables over the entire interregnum and seeing their symmetrical quality.

I don't have a Variable chart in here, but if you think about the 16 Variables, the upper left four and the bottom right four are much more common in incarnation than the bottom left four and the top right four. It's a very interesting thing. Nobody has ever known how it all works. This is part of how it all works. This is as close as we come to being able to see not simply the design of an individual, but to see the way in which life is designed, or what its design is and the way that mechanism works. They're all mechanisms, after all, no matter how incredible they may be.

But it is something to see the preparation that is built up in the Program. Obviously, these are going to be in your download, so I hope that they are inspirational to you. I find them very inspirational. I find it fascinating to be able to dig into all of these things and to unmask them, to be able to reveal what's really there and understand again how this works.

**LELSSON 3**

**Node. This is part of the in-and-out. It isn't directly connected, at least at this level. But it certainly is at the Base level. Nothing is more intrinsically connected to our incarnative agenda than orientation. Obviously, when we're dealing Base, particularly when we're dealing with Personality Base, we are dealing with something, in that context, truly is what we are and is the crystal that has constantly been incarnating and reincarnating. So there's a connection in this whole journey.**

**As you can see, my interests dovetail nicely into what I share with you. Isn't that cute? Ok, let's think about this. Think about the Cross of Life. You have the Sun up here, you have the Earth over here and you have the South Node over here and you have the North Node over there. I guess I can make them cuter. When you're looking at this, this is the root of the life. It's its source. And this is where the life goes. You can think about it as I taught it at its most mundane level as a highway, a big street in a big city, a street so long that in the middle of the street it changes its name, but it's still the same street. There is the South Node part of the street. There's the North Node part of the street.**

**It, ultimately, is one way. And as we know, as one way, they're linked to each other. But again, I want to go back to these two elements in their extremes. After all, this is an aspect of their interpretive value, to look at them as both source and expression. Let's think about what the Link Nodes do for us. The first thing we know about the Nodes is that what we're looking at between the Design and the Personality is a very different configuration. We're looking at a different configuration because, in fact, the Personality and the Design Crystal are very different from each other. The way they operate is different from each other. And, in fact, the stability of the crystal itself is different.**

** is a program of the International Human Design School (HIDS)**This is a truly stable crystal, stable with this construct and the 5th Base in the center. This is the unstable crystal, and the unstable crystal with the 3rd Base in the center. Since there is a shift in these central components in the construct, we have a shift in the way in which the outside is configured. And of course, this is what leads us to be able to see the Link Nodes themselves.

So, as an example, when we're looking over here and again, the 2 is often confusing because it's the same on both sides, that we know that this is the Personality Link Node, this South Link Node. So we see it here. And when we're looking at the Design side, we're looking at the Design North Node and we can see here with the Base orientation to the 1 below, so it belongs over here. What we get is, when we cross them over, if we take them and move them over, so we move that one _[Design North Node]_ so it is over there _[lower right side]_ and we move this one _[Personality South Node]_ so it's over here _[lower left side]_, we can see what happens in the linkage. We get something very important.

### Design Rules the South Node - Personality Rules the North Node

The Design rules your South Node, and the Personality rules your North Node. You can see that both the South Nodes end up, in terms of the Link Node construct, over here on the Design side, where both of the North Nodes end up over there. This is something that is very, very important because normally when you look at the bodygraph, you're ready to interpret this with its Personality value.

Now, I'm not suggesting that you don't. After all, that's the way that it operates on the surface. But in fact, it is the liaison from your body to the Personality side. It, in a sense, limits the way the Personality can operate relative to what the vehicle can provide. They are Link Nodes after all. So the Design is going to rule the South Nodes. It means when you're looking at the Personality South Node, begin to see it in its relationship to the body, not in its relationship to the Personality, not at all.

It's linkage. When they're separate from each other, the way they would be in the design itself, they're separate from each other. This one is over here and this one is over here and as we know, we have these two separate data bases. But without the work of the Magnetic Monopole we have no existence. And the blueprint of existence is written in the independent Variable. And the only way that we're going to exist is if there is this linkage. There is no other way.

Literally, what it means is that the way we classically interpret the values of the specific Link Nodes is something at this level that needs to be reexamined within the context when you're looking at the South Node, this is what the Design rules. It means this is the way the body is going to influence the perspective. It's here that the body will influence the perspective, because it is in the rule of the design.

## The Four Transformations

The transformation business, the four transformations, one of the things about the four transformations is that this is the way it actually works. You start off with a catalyst, your Strategy and Authority, you enter into PHS dietary regimen, but the moment you're operating correctly and enter into the correct environment, you automatically align your perspective. And you automatically align your perspective because your perspective is suddenly aligned to you; boom, boom. It's all there.

So, it brings a different way in which we can analyze this value, to be able to see what that relationship is. And to begin to see in the configuration--and this gets more sophisticated, which we will probably get to in the next lecture--is that the Nodes represent, as the independent, the establishment of what is the perspective. But as we well know, that perspective is going to be determined by the experiential values in the magic square. By the way, those of you who are going to be there in the next _Personality Resonance Mapping_ lecture, I think you're going to see something really incredible. The magic square is something that is really incredible.

It is this relationship of the experiential resonance and the way in which that experiential resonance is interpreted is going to be very, very important to see through the Link Nodes. Of course, this itself is resonance. When you move the Link Nodes back and forth you really begin to change certain configurations and you begin to understand certain subtleties. There are going to be certain things that the vehicle is easily going to be able to establish for the perspective. This is the advantage. The moment the vehicle is operating correctly is the moment this is beginning to resonate correctly.Isn't it interesting the way the Program works? I've described that Program to you. You come into the world, you have your PHS, you're raised according to your nature, you get to 30 years of age, you get to the Saturn point and this is the point you enter into your independent Variable phase. That independent Variable phase goes until you get to the Kiron when you're 51, so you're approximately 30 here, and you're approximately 51 over here and this is this phase here. Then you get the post-Kiron and you get the blossoming and you get the whole thing.

### The Uranus Opposition

In between all of that you have the Uranus Opposition. Of course, this is deeply significant because the Uranus--again, we go back to our whole interregnum story, the discovery of Uranus by Hershel in 1781, the nine-centered vehicle being an Uranian vehicle, the 84-year vehicle. Obviously Uranus is going to be the marker of what is the half-life point for a human being. In other words, the basic marker in terms of what the mean _[midpoint]_ is. So here you have that.

Of course, again, it's not an easy thing. Between 38 and 44 years of age you have your Uranus Opposition. It depends on when you were born, it depends on what Uranus was doing at that particular time because it had an odd orbit or movement, but nonetheless this is fundamentally what the range is for the particular midlife. Cutting this in half, this half over here is South Node. And this half over here is North Node. It is something that's very important to take into consideration.
That is, when you're looking at somebody's chart in the first half of their life this is very important information because this is what is going to be the real South Node phase. It means the perspective that is going to need to develop first is one rooted that 1st line. That is going to be the natural linkage to the form becoming correct. It's only later that it is going to go towards the North Node and a North Node process that will take over. That waits until the midlife point.

They are fascinating instruments for analysis. Again, they point towards a personal evolutionary pattern. It's what we all have. What you're looking at here is the basic life schema, the way it's laid out. Now, obviously there are all kinds of variations in that theme: people come, people go. Life is full of--not to be too cute--conditions and circumstances.

Think about the change in the value. Let's take the example of the Design Link Node and that is going to link to the Personality North Node. In other words, it is going to provide the vehicular stability for the completion of the perspective process in this being.

### Nodal Definition: No Linear Way One's Perspective Develops

Now, this gets complicated by the fact that this is a channel and a definition. I don't want to get into the subtleties of that because it goes deeper and deeper and deeper. But again, it's something to keep in mind, that it influences the way you can analyze any nodal construct. If it's the 40/37, the 34/20 or the 43/23, then you're in a situation where you need to take into consideration the values of the definition.Basically what that means is there is no linear way in which one's perspective develops. It's not really linear. You tend to jump all over the place because it's possible, because there is this ongoing relationship in the juxtaposition in the channel itself. So it creates certain differences. I don't want to mislead you because this happened to be the illustration I had handy. It does qualify it in some ways in terms of the ultimate interpretative value.

In most people's cases where they will not have an opposition that is a definition, then you're really going to see a marked difference between what the priories are working with the body for the first half of the life--you get to see what the formula is. The formula is, you work with the Design side; oh yes, you have your linkage to the Personality _[Personality South Node]_ and by the time you get here that linkage to the Personality begins to do its work. But the real work is the form principle. That is, starting with the PHS, getting to the environment and settling into what the environmental path brings. It's only when you get across the marker. It's not a myth about midlife crises. This is not a myth. This is something that is really out there.

There are people who go through a shock when the name of the street changes. They think they're lost. They don't know what's happened to them, because there is a shift. And the shift is that all the pressure of the independent Variable is now on the North Node Personality side. You're supposed to be ready for that by the time you get here. By the time you get to your midlife you're ready, or at least should be close to it.

So, the emphasis changes; the emphasis moves to the North Nodes. And of course, it sets up this movement. If you take 41 as the midpoint here, it sets up ten years where you move towards your Kiron and you develop on your experiential path and you develop your perspective awareness, but the new focus is going to be here _[North Nodes]_. It just is. And in that new focus being here, obviously, it changes the perspective. In other words, it changes the way in which the perspective is going to positioned exactly. It's a natural growth in the development of the perspective.

Now, of course, we know there are many things that can make this problematic. What we well know is that in dealing with the tonal configuration and distraction at the nodal level, to understand how powerful distraction is, to see that obviously can completely distort the way in which one is being oriented once one gets into that second half of one's life.

## Appendix D 

 

### 1.1 The 40.3: A Denial Body

One of the few things we have not discussed at the deeper level is what happens when you take all of this stuff that we know underneath the surface and bring it to the surface, like here, when you bring it to the gate. And to begin to see through this gate and through this line that this is what it's all about. I'll deconstruct this for you. If you take the 40.3, what you're looking at is the overall way in which this body has to operate. It's about the body.

#### 1.1.1  

 ovian Archive CorporationSo, what you're going to have is a denial body. It's a body that's ready to deny things. It's a body that is ready to shrug; it's a body that is ready to back off. It's all part and parcel of transposing the understanding of the gate to the form principle. We also know what the 3 is; it's very hardy. The 3rd line body is a tough body. It can really take a beating. It can take a beating and come right back up.

_[Note: When asked about interpreting the body at the design nodal-line level, Ra said: It is more of a generalized reference to the holistic value of lines. It does not carry the weight of the internal at all, but all values are in all places, i.e.; genetic continuity.]_

Again, all of this is going to be seen within the context. But the fact is that this kind of body, by being able to see it at the gate and line level, which means you're seeing it at the holistic level, is that you set up a signpost for somebody that points to the fact that they're making progress, because you'll see it in your body.

### The Perception

The other thing is the perception. Everything about the development of the perception is if you want awareness that's post-40, you're going to have to develop it here. So, this 40.1, regardless of what the Color perspective happens to be or the tonal accent on that perspective, this is what you'll resonate to within that context. That 40 and that 1st line are going to become the most important things for you to see.

You set up the fundamental core of what the independent Variable is going to demand for the proper development of this being as it moves forward. It's an extraordinary thing you're looking at. This is how the life gets coordinated. Again, remember they're Link Nodes. In the graphing, in the way you look at them, they look like they belong on the other side, don't they? There are very few people who know that they go across like this.

This is the whole mystery. This is about understanding how the whole thing

works. This is how the Personality and the Design have a relationship to each other. It is only here that Personality and Design truly have a relationship to each other.

Yes, on the surface in the bodygraph, you can see when the Design and Personality meet in a channel, that kind of electromagnetic. But it's not the same thing because that's taking place within the holistic context.

### The Moon

This is where Design and Personality are linked together. Now, that says a lot of interesting things. The first thing it says is about one of my favorite subjects. I'm deeply fond of Moon Goddess. I seem to have a soft spot for Moon Goddesses. The Moon is really so incredible. It's so taken for granted, in a way, that if I were the Moon I would really be annoyed. There is no existence as we understand it on this plane without the Moon. Most mountains never would have risen out of the sea. Most life never would have risen from the surface of the ground. The Moon is everything.

Interestingly enough, in the Hindu Brahmin tradition, reincarnation takes place through the agency of the Moon. As a matter of fact, that's supposedly where the souls come from. The Moon is really unbelievable, if you place in context. The oddity of our solar system, yeah, there are a couple of planets that have no Moons at all, Mercury and Venus, and with the exception of Mars that has a couple of really small ones, everybody else has colonies of Moons. Rarely are they so big in relationship to the planet itself, with the exception of Pluto and Chiron. Even Titan, which is enormous, the great Moon of Saturn, by comparison to Saturn it's not the same as the comparison of our Moon to the Earth.

The Moon has an enormous impact on us; obviously, it's its gravitational pull. It's that gravitational pull that literally creates life. But it does more than that. We are all in the Moon's rhythm; all of us. You actually have tides within your body. Did you ever know that? Did anybody ever tell you that? Everything that carries water every living thing that carries water rises and falls with the Moon. It is just one of those things. We are all so deeply tied to it.

When you see the Moon in the magic square it's one of the corners. It's that dominate force that is there. It is the coordinating force that relates to the Nodes, because after all, what are the Nodes? They are positions and they are positions relative to the Moon because the Moon is everything. This is the life instrument. The Sun, yeah, I know; after all, my name. I understand its beauty and its glory and the warmth of its light. But that'sall pointless without the presence of the Moon. You can play that game in so many different ways, so I don't want to indulge in that, but I certainly enjoy the romance of it. When I see life in this way, when I think about the Magnetic Monopole and the Link Nodes and the Moon, it is so clear to me that the Moon is deeply, deeply, deeply an instrument of the Monopole. If there is any object we have in the solar system that is directly influenced by the Monopole it is the Moon. They have an extraordinary relationship to each other. It is obvious. It is the Moon that makes it possible for the Design and the Personality to be linked together. That's really something to think about. It is truly the mistress of this plane. It is something to think about.

### Base is Deeply Integrated into Every Design

There are no end to subtleties in this movie, are there? Base is something that is deeply integrated into every design. Again, I'll show you in the next lecture. Base is integrated in the most incredible ways in design because what we have learned about Base is its presence is the presence of the constructed maya. It is Base that both within and without creates the very maya we are in. It obviously says something deeply about our orientation. That is, the way in which we can be refined in terms of the way we relate.

One of the things about the way in which orientation works is the kinds of forces you're going to be connected to and interested in. And yet, at the same time, to see it within this context through resonance, you can see that each and every one of us is clearly designed only to resonate to very, very specific things, very specific combinations, and very specific setups.

When you think about differentiation--I talk so much about it, it is so amazing when you dig into this information how differentiated all of it can be, how many possibilities there are--this way, that way, the other way, all of these things--and to see the beauty of that. The deeper we explore these things, the further we get to that place of the finite description, the finite floor plan of the form principle, because this is what it's all about. The moment that the life is properly integrated into its correctness is the moment that all of these things begin to take on their nature.

### The Nine-Centered Uranian Life

But I have a concern. I do. I'm beginning to understand something about the nineteenth Uranian life. It's very much set up as a journey that goes from the body and it goes over here to the mind. This is the journey. And it's a journey that is structured through the life process, through a maturing process based on specific stages. It's the basic construct. I grew up in an era where the baby boomers were deeply affected by a man by the name of Benjamin Spock. He wrote a post-World War II baby care book that became basically a bible for American mothers. It had both positive and negative influences on an entire generation.

One of the things that I know is important is that in understanding of what we are as a nine-centered being has to be put together in a way in which it can be beneficial and helpful so that it can really give people a guide to what this life is about. Again, not so much for the conditioned beings; yes, it is important to know. But as a way of being able to provide the information for those who are coming into the world, to understand them, the baby guide book, to really understand where this being can go, where they must go and how they get there.

We know, in essence, because it cannot be seen that simply, that it is this story first _[Design Sun/Earth Nodes]_. It is only this story that leads to this _[Personality Nodes.]_ The moment this is correct _[Design Sun/Earth]_, the moment that within the context of the way the Program operates for the nine-centered being, when the Strategy and Authority and the dietary regimen are correct, this opens up the possibilities

to really begin to focus on what the life is about, what the life is for.

We are caught in seeing purpose here, incarnation cross, all of that stuff. But the fulfillment of your incarnation cross and the Personality that goes with that is based on the purpose being fulfilled in your movement. This movement isn't just simply the movement in space, but it is the maturation and development of the being and what the priories are. Look at your Link Nodes and go to your design. And in looking at that design, allow it to inspire you to see whether or not that is something you've dealt with, whether that is something you work your way through. It's fascinating to look to see your program because you're looking at your program.

But there is a dilemma in all of this. It's always the same dilemma. If you're post-midlife, you can't start here. You have to go back to scratch, as we all have. We all started conditioned, all of us. We're caught up in the same thing, these two sides of the story. What I can do for you and what I can do for children, unborn children, are two enormously different things. It's how we come to grips with this, because basically when you're looking at it through the Link Node construct, you're seeing what the priorities were for you in the development of your perspective, in the development of your vehicle in the first half of your life.

### Signposts for Conditioned Beings

Most of you will begin to orient to this only after you've entered into your design process because, slowly but surely, you become sensitized to it and where you're going. Everything is a signpost. Remember something, we're mental beings. It's what we are. And the mind is about measurement. Why do you think I love statistics? I don't trust anything I see. But they're so stimulating. It is a way of being able to see how this whole conditioned reality is so deep, deep, deep within us everywhere, the mastery of the Program over all things. And at the same time the ability within us to be able to see through that. Strategy and Authority allows you to be not so much separate from it, but aloof. And then you begin to see the magic.

As conditioned beings, what you have to do more than anything else is understand it's a signpost. It's what the statistics do. It's the measurement; it's why I enjoy them. You get to see a measurement of something here and something there. You get to see the wonder of what's going on in between. Our minds are here to measure; give it something worthy to measure. It can measure the signposts of your life. It can measure your distraction and transference. It can measure and measure and measure.

Every time that it measures, every time you see the transformation to whatever degree, it is this signpost that gives you the courage, because there is no one else to stand there and pat you on the back. And boy oh boy, don't wait for it. You're the only one who has to care, nobody else. You have to give the mind something to measure. You have to give the mind a reason to say, "Oh, all of this seems to be working for us."

The mind is not the bad guy. It can be co-opted. But it needs to see and hear; you can see. You have a whole journey laid out. You have a whole program laid out. How we're held together in the illusion. I don't think there's anything more fantastic to think about. This is what holds us together; this and only this. This is what holds us together.If you don't master this, what exactly do you have? If this is the life and this is what holds us together, if you're not there, what do you have? Not your life.

### Dietary Regimen is the Key

Those who have been conditioned, you have to be sort of in a hurry. But you have to be in a hurry based on what you can handle, based on your own inner authority. But there's one thing that the Link Nodes stress and make so obvious to me is if you don't look after your body, if that isn't your priority, there is no future. It's just obvious. And I mean for those who are pre-midlife. They're less in a rush than many others.

But you have to see that the work on the body is paramount. That is, PHS. Dietary regimen is the key. You can't really get to the discipline necessary to fully live the truth of yourself until you can go through the dietary transformation in your life for so many different reasons. It becomes clearer and clearer to me.

Everything about the conditioned being is going to be able to catch up to the time track. I think all of that is dependent on whether or not it's their serendipity to go deeply into the physical side of this process. It is what the Link Nodes simply bring. This is what it says: _Here's the business. The first half of the life has to be dedicated to the Design._ Now, for most of us that was hardly the truth.

This is the dilemma. This is the dilemma when someone's 50 years old and they show up, want a reading and they start that process. Boy, do they ever have to be deeply, deeply involved and disciplined. There is never 'too late,' there is never 'it can't be.' Obviously, anyone whose time is ready, you hope for the best. But you can see for those who are conditioned, there are a lot of things that have to be dealt with before you get to the other side of the coin. And it's a time structure. It's a movement. Here we are scurrying around to catch up.

### The Variable Process has to be Lived Deeply

I look at Variable and you can see that I look at it in many ways. I find it remarkable that there are 16 paths, that they actually exist, and that you can see them. And though they're generics in and of themselves, each of the 16 Variables are in essence a generic. There are so many variations within them. But it says something so clearly. It says when you can see the mechanics and you can see the way in which it's all laid out, there is no question that we are designed to go through all the transformations that are inherent in the Variable. It's not like this is some kind of false promise or bullshit or whatever the case may be. It isn't.

Mechanically it is there. But the moment you're looking at these transformations, the moment that you're looking at Variable, you have to see that the Variable process is something that has to be lived deeply, deeply, deeply and it's so individual. Think about one of my enduring themes these days, the fading of the Cross of Planning, the coming of the Phoenix. We're coming to an age where it's going to be natural to be concerned about yourself. We start the age of the Phoenix with the precession in the 55.6, which is Selfishness. We start with selfishness as a program. With that background frequency, it's a lot easier to get somebody to understand that this is all about you. It's not about them, it, us, or we. It isn't.

But you have this background frequency that says we're all here for each other and we're going to do it together. I won't do Beethoven again. Everybody is so concerned about their commitments, their connections, their "this and that" with the other, whatever it may be. You don't go anywhere that way. You go alone. It doesn't mean you don't have company. But, boy, do you go alone. You cannot accomplish this any other way. You cannot accomplish this by having to pay lip service to the homogenized world, because all of that just feeds the fundamental insecurities.

### Two Kinds of Approaches in Human Design

Remember one of the things I have been talking about. There are two kinds of approaches in Human Design: One that is the surface and one that's all or nothing. The surface is good for everybody: make decisions correctly, go through your seven-year process, you have a better life and get better awareness. But that's not all or nothing. Variable represents the platform for all or nothing, to go completely through this process, to do it in a deeply mutative way, because after all, this is our situation, but, to do it nonetheless.

Every single one of you--you all know this--have always been different anyway. So you might as well just take it to its extreme. There is no other way to get there, I tell you. There is no other way to get there. You get there from within yourself. These transformations, these steps are ones that you can only take for yourself, because they're not easy steps. They are de-socializing steps. They are disrupting steps. They are provocative steps.

As you take these steps, you are left with your mind and it can be so cruel if you are not its master. It can make you suffer so much if you are not its master. This is what this work, in the end, is about. This work, here, this advanced whatever it is. It's about pulling you deeper and deeper and deeper into your process because this is where everything happens. This is where the magic happens.

This is where you get to live out the nuances that are laid out here, the beauty of it, because everyone has it. And you finally get to see what your life is about, not simply because it's something you can analyze, but it is something that you can actually live, so you can establish that foundation, so you can express as outer authority the awareness that is possible.

### You Can Only Become Aware by Yourself

It's not an easy road, and difficult. I thought about this. I can take, for example, a bibilical dozen. Let's make it 15 and make a nice WA. I take you out into the wilderness for seven years and try to train you to be aware. It would be a disaster. I'd make you smarter. You only become aware by yourself. I can expand your knowledge base. I can help you hone your intelligence. But I cannot make you aware. That's you.

It means how far you're going to go to strip away the conditioning in your life. That's ultimately the question. And it is not something you carry as a burden. I want you to understand that as well. It can only be what it's going to be. It's only going to work the way it's going to work. We will all see where this gets to as we all move along in the turning of the wheel.

Frankly, for somebody like me, it's all ok. It's always been all ok. There is nothing else for it to be. But for you, it's always the same. It's up to you how far you go, how ready you are to go the distance, all those things, because that's what this all leads to in the end.

That was enjoyable. I've said my fill, but if anybody has a question the last ten minutes I don't mind answering a couple of questions.

## Q & A

_Question: When you were giving an example here of the Link Node in the body, you said with the 40 line 3 would be a body of denial. What does a body denial look like, as opposed to a Personality? I know what that looks like in denial._

**Ra:** Ok, a classic example is you're standing at the bar in a cafe and somebody of the opposite sex, or maybe the same sex depending on one's inclinations, somebody shows up and stands beside you and obviously they're interested in you. Your body will tell them to go away. Your body will literally deny them access, the frequency that it puts out, a frequency that's much more powerful than what the voice would say, as an example, or what the conscious ego of that would do. It's quite different.

Bodies give off signals. One of the things we see--I'm going to be doing that next semester, that is, this semester I do _Personality Resonance Mapping_ and next semester I'm going to do _Design Resonance Mapping_. And of course, in the _Design Resonance Mapping_ what you get to see is the body itself, our bones, our flesh, our liquids; all of this is constantly fluctuating relative to the influences around it.

So, a denial body is a frequency that is being picked up by others and it's a frequency they get to read right away, so the moment that person breaks the auric plane is the moment that frequency is going to push them off and they won't do anything. Again, it's just one of things.

If you go back to the work we did in chains, as an example, particularly working from the Design side of that, see that the references there are always to the various kinds of line bodies, though I didn't do the gate interpretations of them. I think it's one of those things that is healthy for you to exercise, to think about the information that's there in the gate and try to see how you could apply that to either the Design or the Personality side. It's certainly good training.

_Question: Thanks. It's interesting to see it in terms of the nodal journey. Obvious-ly, you're saying PHS really is the key to helping the nodal environment journey. Then you mentioned that there is a signpost here. I suppose that wouldn't be so much in recognizing what the body is doing. It would be in recognizing more the linkage the other way for the Personality? And then I couldn't quite see what the signpost would be when the body Node is on the Personality side._

**Ra:** You're talking about the nature of the signpost on this side, as far as I understood the question. You'll have to rephrase it because I got confused listening to how you laid it out. So, just hold a second. Rephrase the question and let me get to Elfriede for one second.

### Timing of the Development of the Nodes

_Question: Can you say that the two South Nodes have to be developed between 30 and 40 between Saturn and Uranus opposition, and the two North Nodes between 40 and 50 between Uranus opposition until the Kiron return? And is there a special time difference between the Design South Node and the Personality South Node?_

**Ra:** Basically, Elfriede, yes. That is the important transitional area. That is the 30 to 40 has to be fulfilled, the 40 to 50 on the other side is the beginning of the other. But it really is a split in the middle.

More interesting in your question is the reference to the difference to the South Nodes. Obviously, the Design Node has superiority seniority, that's better. The Design Node has seniority over the Personality Link South Node in that obviously it is earlier in the Program. Again, this would come to one of analytical issues. I'm going to continue, by the way, with these in later lectures so we can continue looking at many of these elements. I just want to bring in some other factors.

Ok, Kumud, try again.

### Signpost for Design Node linking to the Personality Node

_Question:__Ok, what does the signpost for the Personality look like when the 37 from the Design side comes and links to the Personality Node?_

**Ra:** That's those moments when you get to see the body adjust to what is being seen. For example, let's say that you're looking at something and suddenly you get to see because your perspective is correct, you get to see something is about to happen. Let's say a car is about to come in your direction, or whatever the case may be, there is this immediate relationship to the response to the body.

In other words, it appears like the body is almost responding on its own, but it's actually being guided by the perspective. That's just off the top of my head. As I go through this I hope at some point in all these advanced programs to get to integrating any of these deeper aspects into a comment as it applies to their overall holistic chart. Even just seeing it here, again, is a limitation in not being able to see it within the entire holistic configuration. It's interesting stuff, nonetheless.

### Nodal Phases-You Can't Go Back

_Question:__So Ra, in past times when we weren't in this deep level of work you used to talk about how the South Node, once you crossed over, you were on a different boulevard, and what I hear you say today, I believe, is that there is no way that we really can really go into the depth of ourselves unless we unwind what should have been unwound in my life before I met Design. I met Design almost at 50, so I was past every phase of the transition. But you're saying in order to really have the deep transformation we have to go back. But if I remember right in your old lectures you used to talk about that the impression of the South Node is just like a faint image, almost like a watermark. Anyway, I'm just looking for some clarity._

**Ra:** You're absolutely right, Cathy, there is no question about it. The fact is that as you move from the South Node phase to the North Node phase, obviously the North Node phase begins to dominate. It is certainly important in general analytical work. In other words, in working with somebody who is pre-midlife, being able to help them prepare for the transition, the themes of the South Node are no longer going to be the themes they work with.

The advantage that lies in this, and you're right in the sense that you can't go back, as you well know. There is no going back. But because of the power of awareness, the variability through the knowledge to be able to see one's relationship to the South Node construct that was there, to be able to see one's movement and at the same time by being aware of it--after all, this is not going to disappear. For example, this is a classic case because of the very definition, there's no way you can really lose it, if you know what I mean.

There are all kinds of variations in that theme. What it does say is that those beings who come to Design in their midlife or beyond their midlife, there is a certain zeal, something you've obviously shown in your own process, that's necessary because there is so much work to be done. It's not about those beings who are going to meet Human Design and simply experiment with their Strategy and Authority and benefit from it. I think that's wonderful and it's going to be the vast majority of people. It already is the vast majority of people. There are very few people in Human Design who are educated at this level know anything about the way these things function.

Of course, it is only when you get to this level that you realize there is a place to go, if you know what I mean. And I think one of the things to understand about your inner development is that the more you grasp, the more aware you become, the more aware you become, the more aware you become, the about.

Day by day as I go through teaching, it becomes clearer and more evident to me that the need to accelerate the work on the body for those who are committed to the long run is something that's so important. This means they need to have a great deal of psychological support in being able to establish their power, their own inner power, their own strength to be able to move through this.

Anyway, it's all interesting. Thanks to all of you. Thanks to you Adrian. Take care; bye for now.

 

## 11 **Lesson Four**

Hello and welcome to all of you. It's nice to see that there are a bunch of you who could make it here today. It's odd for me because it is very, very rare, other than the Ibiza Event. I don't ever teach on the weekend, particularly on Saturday, sometimes on Sundays, but rarely on Saturday. It's a very different frequency, the Saturnian frequency. I suggest that because of the depth of what we're going to look at today, because I think this is one of those remarkable places you can get to when you've had the luxury, as I've had over these many years now, to dig deeper and deeper and deeper down to be able to see the mechanisms. I suggest you might want to listen to this one again.

I have a new term for you that I will introduce today and it is called _transposition_. And let alone that just about no one in Human Design knows what a Link Node is, this is really going to another place. North and South Tonal Transposition, and I will get to that as we move along.

### 11 The Link Nodes

So let's begin by doing little review here and making sure we're all on the same page. We're looking at the phenomena of the Link Node, and first of all, we have to go back to the very pure mechanical essence of what this is about. I don't think you should ever lose perspective of that because I think it's very significant.

What we're looking at is what holds the life together. It is that significant, in that sense. It is through the Link Nodes that what we call Design and Personality find their commonality in what turns out to be the holistic being that is us. In the sense that they are a by-product of the Moon, and that's something that I look at in relationship to the lunar planetary square, it's also to be able to grasp something about what the independent Variable is really all about. It is about establishing the life. And it is about establishing the life in which the life is neither the Design nor the Personality.

What makes the Link Nodes, the Nodes themselves so extraordinary is that they are agents of the Monopole. This is what makes them extraordinary. It's the Monopole that holds you together in the illusion of separateness. It is the Monopole, through the agency of the Nodes, which fulfills that. And it's through the Link Nodes that this holding together is established.

### Base Orientation

So, how do we establish the Link Nodes? Again, it's important to go back for a moment, because what we're going to see is that it is a formula that operates right through the whole construct. We establish the nature of the Link Node by looking at Base orientation. It's Base orientation that gives us our key. Of course, in the Link Node we see that the Base orientation, as an example in this particular case in looking at this Design North Node in the 46.4, you can see that the Base orientation, because this is the Design Link Node, actually belongs over here. In other words, the way in which it's oriented is towards this other side. And of course, what we get to do is transpose it; that is, we get to put it down here so that we can actually see it in the position that it influences.On the other side, it's exactly the same thing. In other words, we have the Personality Link Node and the way we define it is through its basic orientation. We know that orientation--and again, remember that the 2s and the 4s are always the same--what we know as the Link Node goes here. And of course the same thing again; that is, to be able to see it in its actual position. The moment you were able to see it here, the first thing that I suggested to you last time we were together--and again, I'm going to introduce these various elements and then as we move along I'm going to come back and we're going to integrate them all back together again.

The first step is to see something very fundamental. The South Node is ruled by the Design in the sense that it is there to fulfill the dynamics necessary for the form principle to be able to house the holistic process. And when you go over to the other side, again, what you're seeing is the ability of the vehicle to establish the best possible qualities for the perspective or the view that is going to be there. It is the Personality that is going to rule the North Nodes.So we have this beginning of a way analytically to see the Nodes in different levels, to peel away from one level to the next. As I said, I don't want to get into this because we will come back to this in detail. I need to get to the core of this story because you might think, given the lead up to all of this, that the core of the story is here. In other words, seeing the Link Nodes and having an understanding that is Design and this Personality, and so forth. Well, to some degree. There obviously is always a great deal of information there. But we haven't seen the whole process yet of what linkage is all about.

### The Archetype of the Holistic Being

Here is the design, by the way, that goes with this. It is something to consider about the nature of it. We're dealing with a 25-46 combination. One of the things we will look at as we move ahead is examples of differentiated Nodes. For example, instead of having two duplicates in terms of gate duplication, what we're going to have is four different gates. It adds a whole different dimension to how you interpret this when you bring it up to the holistic surface. Remember, this is holding the vehicle together so it's something that's very important to understand about those gates.

It is out of these gates that the archetype, if I can put it that way, of the holistic being emerges. These are the most integrated gates that you're going to have in your design. Of course, it's going to be different for different people, different designs. But something, again, to understand about what I keep referring to on the surface, it's not really a surface, it's very deep down. But in terms of the Variable surface, looking at Variable and understanding the independent Variable and the whole nature of the independent Variable brings the nurturing dimension. It brings the environmental quality that is absolutely essential and to begin to see that it is through those gates in particular and the way in which they are established within the framework of the bodygraph is going to create another level of interpretation.

This is obviously not a consistency. And it is something that is only going to take place out of conditioning, which is something else entirely. In other words, there are many, many levels for us to look at in terms of the way in which this is interpreted. One of the most fascinating things about this is that you can interpret at the holistic level, because this is what it does. It's actually creating this bodygraph.

### 4.2.2 Tonal Transposition

So, you can see something very interesting about the core here. Core isn't very well connected to the way in which the life is working. It's not one of those questions I've been asked. We're looking at the Link Nodes and we're seeing that you have this movement from one to the other. But it's not just this. We know in doing analysis it's very clear that what we're looking at here is deeply, deeply, deeply influenced by the Color and the Tone. At the moment you take that South Node on the Personality side and bring it over here and place it in association with the Design South Node, you place it in association with what, in fact, is a different Color and Tone. Don't you?

This is called _Tonal Transposition_. Now, the Color doesn't matter. So here you can see it illustrated more clearly. We're going to look at the South Nodes and the Link Nodes. Here we can see the Coloring from the Personality side and that this is our Link Node with its 4 Base orientation _[Gate 25.2]_. You can see it came from over here _[Personality side of chart]_.

If we look at where it came from, so this is the association to this _[pink star]_ and where it went to, which is there _[blue star]_ you can see that the transition here is from the 3\({}^{rd}\) Tone to the 5\({}^{th}\) Tone _[tones circled]_. In other words, rather than this particular Node having its natural affiliation to what is the 3\({}^{rd}\) Tone in terms of seeing in through its linkage, it actually now is being impacted by the 5\({}^{th}\) Tone _[gold star]_.All right, what does that mean? It's pretty much the symbol of Tone with the Left on one side and the Right on the other side. Now, as I said, there is no Color influence change here. This is not about Color. This is entirely about Tone, but it's entirely about Tone at a very, very, very basic level. So, let me give you an example. You can see that if we're looking to where it came from in the natural setup of the chart, we're looking at something that is Left. I don't want to put in the Left context of the Personality.

But it's Left-ness. This is what dominates on this side. And regardless of whether the linkage is going to be back over here, it isn't going to change that. This 3 is going to dominate it and, in fact, when the other one crosses to the other side we get the North, the same thing is going to happen on the other side. It's an equal process. Nonetheless, this is a Left and what we get to see is that this is a Right.

### Linkage between the Body and the Personality

So what does that mean? Let's take the example of this being. What we're getting here is a linkage between the body, because we know the Design rules the South Node. So what we're getting here is a linkage between the body to the Personality. The linkage is demonstrated by a change in the body's frequency when the alignment is correct. So, let me give you an example of what the Personality North Node perceives, that's what you're conscious of, that is what's looking. Now when its perspective is correct, what is going to happen then is that the body itself, because the way in which the body is going to operate, the moment that body has got it aligned correctly, is the moment it is going to go through the passive side _[5\({}^{th}\) Tone circled above]_.Basically what that means is that the honing in on what is correct can create a deep calmness in the body, a deep peacefulness if I could put it that way. If you were going the other way around, the body could suddenly get very agitated, could become very active the moment the process of the honing in is correct. In other words, there is a linkage that takes place. It becomes something else. It becomes a sign post. It's very subtle, but at the same time it's there.

One of the most important things to understand about what's going on in the linkage--it's one of those things about understanding, for example, somebody who's Personality right and Design left. How do those things work with each other? It's done at the tonal level. This is where it is done. And it brings a shift.

Here you can see that we're going to go the other way. In other words, we're dealing with the North Node phenomena and the 46.4, that is actually coming from over here _[Design side]_ and you can see that down below here's the 46.4 _[pink star]_, here's the 3 _[Personality Tone]_, this is where it came from _[left-sided arrow]_, this is where it's going to _[right-sided arrow]_. It's going from the 5 to the 3. It came from the 5 _[tone on the Design side]_ over here and it's going over here to the 3 _[tone on the Personality side]_.

So, what's happening is that the Design North Node, which is now over here, instead of being rooted into the Right is now rooted to the Left. Basically, what that means is that it's bringing certain sensory qualities into a heightened state. There are fundamental shifts that take place the moment the Link Nodes are aligned to the tonal cognition on the other side. Remember that everything about bringing us together has to be based on cognition. It can't be based on anything else.

## The Cognitive Architecture

Everything about what we are in the holistic sense is about demonstrating our cognitive capacity. After all, this is the whole story. Everything about that cognitive capacity we know is here _[tones circled below]_. In fact, we well know that it's there. That what makes Variable is the Tone. This is one of the most extraordinary things about the nature of Tone. What makes it so phenomenal is that, in essence, everything about the nature of our individual lives is governed by Tone. It has to be. This is where the cognitive architecture is. So, the only way a holistic being can be established who has a truly cognitive potential is if the cognitive architecture is in some way aligned from one side to the other. This is what makes it all possible. It makes it possible because it's taking place at that level where it makes this holistic being a reality.

So when we're talking about Link Nodes we're not just talking about the Nodes, we're actually talking about linking Tones, because that's really what we're doing, we're linking Tones. We're linking things to a specific cognitive quality. The reality is that, yes, of course, we see them in the dynamic of the ordinary bodygraph and we well know that the story is not obvious when you see it like this, which is the way everybody sees it, at least within the AI context.



 

### 4.2.1 Tonal Transposition is the Key Ingredient for Life

This is something that is very, very deep within us. It's the thing that makes it so fascinating for me because when you get to this level and you understand what tonal transposition is, just in the most rudimentary sense, give yourself time, we'll get to a deep level of this. But just thinking about it, this is the key ingredient. It's the key ingredient for what we call the life. It's more than the value of the cross and its profile. It's more significant, in that sense. And it carries the same value as your cross gates do.

This is something that, despite how deep it is within us, is very, very much alive on the surface in the bodygraph. One of the things to understand about Link Nodes is that you are looking not at the Design or the Personality, and you can see that in a way, because they get jumbled together. It's not about really seeing Design or Personality. It's about seeing what the Monopole brings.

### 4.2.2 The Nodes are the Instruments of the Monopole

So, everything having to do with the Monopole, and because we know that the Monopole has this extraordinary relationship, the Nodes are instruments of the Monopole. This is something really to grasp. They do the work; they express the Monopole in the same way that the Sun/Earth's express the Personality and the Design Crystals in the Design and Personality configurations.

This is where the Monopole rules and this is where the Nodes rule in the bodygraph, because this is where the life is. And they bring the life together through Link Nodes. They bring the life together not as some kind of Frankenstein experiment where you throw this piece with that piece and you hope for the best. They bring them together with a coordinated cognitive plan, because that's what it is, a coordinated cognitive mechanism. By the way, not that it matters, but you might be curious, this is the design of Bob Dylan.

### Significance on the Surface

I'm a simple man, I really am. I like to see things as simply as I can. It is so important to understand that Link Nodes are about the surface. We will work on the detail of how you can look at it in terms of its analytical qualities. But the first thing to really grasp is the surface of this.

All right, what are they doing? This is our set up for life _[Nodes]_. And of course, the thing to recognize is that aside from whatever the values are that we're going to be able to see here, it means that these gates in particular have a real significance on the way the life program is going to be lived out. It does, does it not? Everything makes a difference. Life, particularly in the way the Human Design System sees many different kinds of geometries and different kinds of ways in which we operate within the general movement. This is somebody who is a 4/6. They're right angle. It means they're self-absorbed in their process. They have personal destiny. They're a single definition with personal destiny.

And yet their life, the way in which it is intended to be held together is something that is deeply, deeply open in them, an undefined G, just the simple level. It's not like that's anything other than ancient in my teaching. I first introduced the Cross of Life in the early '90s. One of the main themes was: where is it in your design? It's true of anybody's Sun/Earth and Nodes. Where are they in your design? Are they part of the definition? Are they open? What's the not-self strategy that rules them? If you have your Sun or your Earth in an open center it means that it's a pressure within you to release it always. And with the nature of the Nodes, because they represent our lives, how extraordinarily difficult it is. Remember that my referencing here is particularly, simply to not-self.

After all, if you're operating correctly you never have to worry about where you're going. That's the most beautiful thing about Strategy and Authority. Strategy and Authority is a magical thing. It simply puts you in the right navigational trajectory. But without that, this is a life that has a hole in it. It just does; it feels like that.

## Be Careful about the Attention Paid to the Personality Nodes

Let's take a look. Remember where we're coming from. Let's take the start of the 25 and think about the fact that in most analyses when you're going to be looking at perspective, as an example, you're going to pay attention to the Personality South Node. I would be very careful about how much attention you pay to it. The Nodes are oppositions, so you're going to have the Line, the Color, and the Tone. I would stay as a marker with the quality of **not** the Link Node, but the quality of the Node that remains. In terms of analysis on the Personality side, the information is rooted in the line, the color and the tonal impact in terms of the view, and so on. But I would focus on the line value of the North Node as a significant theme.

Now, remember, you're going to have the North Node movement coming across and, of course, it's going to bring with it another line value. But that's no longer important. Remember, the only thing that matters when it comes across is the way in which it's going to relate to the tonal quality itself.

## Frequency: View Affects the Body which Affects the View

So, let's look at something. I want to take you back so you can see both at the same time. So we have the Normal up here and we have the Transposition down here, so we can see the differences, in that sense. Okay, so let's go over here to the top. Let's begin on the Design side. We know when we're looking at the Design side, obviously this is environmental, and we know that as far as the Color is concerned that this is going to be the environmental shores and the basic things we know about the values of that. And in the context of the environment, what the Tone is going to bring.

But remember, what we're particularly interested in here is this frequency. We're interested in the Right frequency. Remember that when we are looking at the body relative to the Design external, we can see whether the body, generally speaking within the environment, is going to be active or passive. So what we know here is that this is designed to be a passive vehicle.

Now remember that it's coming from the other side where it's been very active. The setup on the other side to the Left is much more strategic. But what's very important is that the moment that the view is correct, there is this deep, deep, deep calmness in the vehicle.

You have to understand something about active/passive. These are really huge generalizations. So one of the things you see the moment you're looking to the Design side--and we see that the Tone is to the Right side--it means that in order for the perspective to work, it has to be very, very, very calmed down. And that moves across. It just does. It affects, for example, the way the gaze works. Whether that's going to be a very active looking around or a very relaxed viewing, all of these kinds of subtleties are coming into play.

Of course, what it means is that when there is correctness, when the perspective is particularly honed and the view is not being influenced by its distraction, that's the moment there is a shift in the scale of what passive is. If you started a midpoint between being a little this way or a little that way, it starts toning things way down. In fact, it becomes a signpost. This sudden sense of relaxation is a by-product of the acuteness of the perception.

### Subtle Differences in the Way This is Interpreted

Again, there are many, many elements in this. Be very careful about what you do with this. It's my constant warning to all of you. There are so many levels to see. So, we're going to have this shift away from the 3 coming over like that _[yellow star]_. Now, it does something. Again, this is one of the things to understand about that. The message of this _[tone 5 circled]_ isn't really here _[pink star 25.2]_; it's over here _[blue star 25.2]_ if you know what I mean. In other words, this is the Link Nodes. I put it graphically like this _[lower section of illustration]_ so that you can see them link ing. But in fact, they're always on either sides of the program _[upper section of illustration]_. It's just they're linked to each other through what, in essence, is part of capture frequency. So it is over on the other side, but it's over on the other side tuned to this _[tone 5 circled]_. So it catches, if you will, the calmness. It catches the setup of the vehicle in order for the view to be honed.

It also means that you can have a very, very subtle differences in the way you interpret this. One of the things about this is that it divides us into two different qualities of perception. That is, the cognition is influenced by the frequency. This is all juxtaposition. One thing is always going to influence the other. The other thing is that these values _[indicated below]_, one of the basic ways that I introduce the Nodes was not to really think of them as being different from each other. Yes, there is the South Node theme at the beginning and the North Node theme in the second half of life and the Uranus opposition; yes, all of those things are so. But again, there are many, many levels of looking at things.

### Synthesizing the Elements

The Nodes are basically a road. And the only way that you can really understand the road is to synthesize the elements. I like to use the example of language. It has always helped me in the past. Basically, if you're looking at the South Node, this is the **verb**. And this is the **adjective**. It's the same thing on the other side; here's the verb, here's the adjective. In other words, the Link Node is a supporting description.

Let's take just the basic keynotes. That is, the 25.2 is the Existentialist and the 25.4 is Survival. Now that survival theme is going to be a big deal. But it's going to be a big deal that has to be taken in through that existential adjectival support. That survival is a big theme. And it is a big theme for the cognitive program. It's means the environment for this being is going to be very, very important for them.

### The Hierarchy in Nodal Transposition

Everything that many of you have studied in the various programs, one of the things I'm always introducing you to is the different levels of hierarchy. The hierarchy, for example, the way in which the impact of open centers on the way the not-self mind makes decisions and so on. There is a hierarchy here in the nodal transposition.

The moment you put them into transposition, you get to see the hierarchy, which means that you can fine tune the way to see the way, if I can put it that way without being confused. In other words, to truly understand on one side, basically through survival you can become a prima donna. Oh, Bob, look at that. Did I call him out, or was that terrible of me? You see the path of a life, don't you?

You're seeing the path of the life. And of course, there are always going to be underlying elements. The existentialism of 25.2, and of course the impact of the 46.4, yeah sure. Of course, what it's saying is that the body provides the potential for the impact _[red arrow]_. And you get to see the life. If you get to see the life, you get to see the way in which the Link Nodes set up the holistic being _[pink star]_.

### Look at Your Life Story and How You Get There

You have two things to look at here. One says here's your life story _[blue star]_. Look at yours; it's really fun. Here's your life story. And the other says that this how you get there, because that's how you get there. Here's your life story; here's how you get there _[yellow star]_. You get there because of the Link Nodes. You don't get there for any other reason. It's the Link Nodes that hold us together, blah, blah, blah, and all that stuff.Of course the beauty of the story is that you can take each of these and associate them with the perspective Color/Tone, and then you really see it. There's no bridging between them. This is real dualism here. The bridging, again, is the life itself. This is the thing that makes it so beautiful, because the moment you have this you have the life itself. You have a juxtaposition that creates the life. What we get out of this is two extraordinary tools.

One of the things I've been unable to do, and it will begin in the third semester this year, is I'm going to do of a program called _Advanced Analysis_. I'm going to take all of these very, very deep things, all of the many, many different areas that I am aware of at this point and show how you can bring **any** of them to the surface. Now, obviously, they come in different ways. But I think one of the things that is missing at this point, because I've spent years now in laying out all kinds of theoretical data, is seeing the ways in which all of this information can be synthesized to the surface and this is really a place to begin. This is the core of the life.

### Everything is Built on the Link Nodal Formula

If I ever got to a place where I could imagine developing a whole new level of analysis, the kind of analysis that is more associated with science and geonome studies than it would be with anything practical for most people other than students, you build it here. You build it here because this is where the life is built. Everything is built on this. And everything is built on the Link Nodal formula, which is fascinating.

If you're looking for the great scripted story, it is so easy now to be able to, in a way, if you take all the possible combinations obviously relative to what is their Tone and Color, then basically you have all the storylines. You have the basic storylines, and then after that, all you have to do is see that within the nuance of somebody's life. If you're going to build the story of this life, you have to start here _[G Center]_.

I've worked at analysis so long. I started at the top going down and you look at everything that way. But I would really like to have the time to rebuild, not so much analysis as to create a-I don't know, what would we call it-a constructive revealing (laughing); I don't know what we would call it. And I don't even know how to fully to explain it. That is, to actually build the being out from the independent Variable. One of the ways that I'm going in terms of my thinking is that if one really wants to understand the life at its **deepest** level, which is far beyond anything on the surface, then you have to begin here _[independent variable]_. This is where you have to start. It's the only place you can start.

If you start here, and because it is the thing that is holding you together, that **where** it's holding you together or **how** it's holding you together becomes an enormous story. It just does. It becomes your story. This is the story of an innocent form with a Personality that is going to push upwards, all of those things that are inherent in all of this. But then you have to see it within the context of it, see what it means to take this central information and then go to the very, very surface of the knowledge and look and see where it is.

Remember, this is your life story. I hope all of you are thinking about your own. Where are your Nodes? All of my Nodes are part of my single definition. They are all deeply, deeply integrated. My life story is totally within my hands. But, his life story, indeed was not. And you can see that it took other human beings to align him to this--an open G. And again you're dealing with a not-self. On, the life gets lived out. You cannot stop this from happening any more than you can stop this G Center. This G Center is almost never open.

And of course, with true inner authority this is not a navigating problem. As not-self it certainly is, always going to suffer, no matter what is there.

### Operating Out of the Mind Distorts Tonal Cognition

And remember, if you're operating out of your mind, your whole tonal cognition is distorted anyway. The Nodes operate just at a brute level because they have to be cause they're the instruments of the Monopole holding you together. And yes, there is this movement. The so-called "midlife crisis" is mostly just simply the failure of linkage to be able to produce anything other than distortion and deterioration. For the vast majority of human beings it's not possible to be subtle at this level.

You have to be very careful with what we're doing because the reality is that this is incredibly subtle in the way it's going to operate. It's not going to be visible in those beings who are not correct. It isn't necessarily something that is truly going to operate well unless it is environmentally correct and we know that this is a major step in anyone's life. Everything having to do with cognition, anyway, is going to be rooted in whether one's dietary regimen is correct and whether one has the enhancement necessary to be able to take advantage of the cognitive that is there.

The dilemmas of what it is in the surface, yes, yes, yes; for the not-self that's a real trip. You end up with a lot of people claiming to have made your life possible (laughing). You really do. And of course, to some degree it's true. It's just something that happens along the way. After all, this is simply about how aware you're going to be. In the end, it's always and only about awareness. But there is magic in this, this level, to be able to see what's going on, and to be able to understand the interpretive qualities, to be able to get a grasp on how you do the interpretation.

### Advanced Analysis

It's one of the reasons why that I want to do some kind of level of advanced analysis. I don't think anybody, particularly--there may be some people intuitively, I suppose--but not everybody is comfortable with translating the value of a gate on the Design side. They're not necessarily comfortable with deconstructing the line value to the Design side, or to seeing the line value in terms of body type.

One of the things we work with in PHS and Rave Psychology in chains is to look at the influence of lines in relationship to their physical nature, not just simply seeing them from the Personality nature, but really being able to see the difference. That 1st line in a body can make for very nervous body, a very, very alert, on-guard body. There are different frequencies you get. Or the 3rd line with the toughness of their body; there's real strength in there. Or the 2nd line, which has that vulnerability, the Achilles tendon phenomena in the 2 body. All of these bodies--the 4th line with the easiness of its fatigue.

Everything single aspect is always like that. One of the things you have to be able to do at the deeper levels of this in terms of analysis is begin to be creative in the way you think of the differences between Design and Personality. It's taken me many, many years to be able to show students the fundamental differences between Design and Personality. Those differences, in the end, we finally get to see at the tonal level where the Tone relationship to the Color is totally different between Design and Personality.

What it really leads to, in my juxtaposition work, is an understanding that the crystals themselves are very different in the way in which they're constituted. The Personality Crystal, and obviously something that is incredibly durable, is enormously stable. I say "incredibly durable" because it is the crystals we are endowed with that have been in existence for 14, 15 billion years. Design Crystals have of an incredible spectrum of duration. They're much more unstable, in that sense. That difference in stability--why we die? Nobody really knows; not really. But the Design Crystal is something that deteriorates. That is, it's not stable. At some point, it is just grabbed back into the embrace of the Monopole and that's the end of the story.

There is a fundamental difference between the Design and the Personality. It means that the tonal construct, the way in the inner architecture of the Design Crystal and the inner architecture of the Personality Crystal are arranged, that in essence, this is different. Again, this goes back to why these diagrams are different from each other in that it is a different way in which they are constructed.

So, obviously, when we're looking at the Design and the Personality, because we've gone through a stage where we understand how different they are, it makes these Link Nodes even more incredible. This is the glue. And if it's the glue, it is also the core, and if it's a core, then it's the basis of what can be a totally different kind of analytical approach.

### Alignment to Orientation Changes Aspects of the Perspective

There is also something else to consider. The alignment to the orientation--and we will take a look at that--also changes aspects of the perspective. Everything is like this. My joke about this is building the seat so that eventually the passenger can be aware. The way we build that seat is this way. This is the way it works. What we know about that is we have a catalyst: Strategy and Authority. The cleansing process is the seven-year deconditioning cycle **and** dietary regimen. If you really want to get to the subtlest levels of this process, the dietary regimen is not something you can do without. It is the only thing that really prepares the system for this acuteness of awareness.

It also means that with dietary regimen--and again this is a foundation process--we enter into what is the correct environment. The moment that this process is there--Strategy and Authority and dietary regimen enter into the environment--is the moment that the way in which the Link Nodes operate begin to produce results. They begin to produce results because of the tonal transposition. It allows for the holistic cognitive process to take place. The holistic cognitive process takes place along the independent Variable. This is where we establish that process and we establish the potential of that process. That opens the doors for awareness. It's what establishes the possibility for the passenger consciousness.

In order for the perspective to be correct, the perspective has to be aligned correctly to the environment. Again, this is what the Link Nodes do. They're going to do that in a way that allows the tonal information to cross the barrier--because this is what it's all about. It allows the tonal information to cross the barrier each way. In other words, the cognitive architecture of the form and the cognitive potential of the Personality coming together form the cognitive potential of the whole. This is how you get the holistic life. This is where it comes from. You have to see how important it is for us to be aware.

I couldn't push awareness for a long time. I had to push breakthrough: get out of the Program, discover the beauty of what it is to be you, here's your real inner authority, experiment with this. The basis of breaking through the surface, as you all well know, it's not an easy thing, just to break through the surface. The surface is so dense. But once you've broken through the surface, once it's become, through deconditioning, through the seven-year process, once it's become a natural thing for you, you already know what happens. It begins to change the way in which you see. It begins to change the way you think. It begins to change your awareness, because you open up these possibilities for the acute awareness that is always there.

But in order for this cognitive potential to be fulfilled, all the elements have to be correct, because you have to be able to get the tonal information across the barriers. You don't do that if there's no Strategy and Authority. You don't do it well if there is Strategy and Authority but there is no dietary regimen. It's a progression. But in the end, nothing sets up awareness until the chair is in place. The passenger has to have everything in place.

It's why I laugh at passenger Personality and call it useless, helpless and incompetence, because it is. It really is. It's just waiting there to put on the show. That's what it's good at. And the show is beautiful, or can be I suppose. We don't see too many of them. Outer authority can be a magical thing. By the time you get to a point where the awareness is there, it isn't the point anymore. It's always like that. By the time you get to that place, it's not about anything. It's just about the it-ness of what it is to exist. There isn't anything else.

It's the beauty of the potential of what we are as a cognitive being. All of this goes back to the tonal level. And you have to get it across. It's not enough that it's working ok on one side; they both have to work. And the information has to be available to both sides so it can be coordinated. So, you can see what it means when you bring those two things together, that we can begin to do with the kind of research that we will do one of these days, to begin to define certain holistic types and not in the context of Manifestor, Generator or whatever. There are only so many combinations. But they really do set up a way of seeing that's quite amazing.

### Look at the Non-Linked South and North Nodes

One of the first things to do when you are experimenting with this is to take the non-linked South Node and the non-linked North Node and look at quite a few charts of people you know and see this within the context of what Color and Tone tell you. Look at this through their gates and their lines and try to see the story of their life. And because you know them, because it does work, you get it. It's important for you to see it, because this really is the story. Yes, we know that there's other stuff involved. But for most human beings this is what they want.

If I was going to make my living as a soothsayer in the old-fashioned sense-- wouldn't I look cute with one of those turbines and a crystal ball--I would be really good at telling people about their future. All I would need to have is their independent Variable and I can do a real good story. And if I saw their design, I could do it even better--the trials and tribulations of the not-self on the roads of the Nodes, yes, yes, yes, because it's all there. And you need to see it.

Not only do you need to see it in that context, but you also need to see those gates in relationship to the design itself to understand something so fundamental about us. It doesn't matter whether you're right angle, juxtaposition or left angle. It doesn't matter if you are right-tonally oriented or left-tonally oriented. It doesn't matter what your independent Variable is about. If you're alive on this planet, you're going to be influenced by the other; period. Whether you're going to be influenced directly, or through Pentas, or through WAs, however it's going to be, they're always going to be there and the potential of the conditioning is always there because your receptors are always there. How powerful the receptors are in the 46 and 25 here, how much they need to be expressed.

### The Point is Navigation not the Design

The point is not the design; always remember that. The point is how you navigate, not the design. Nobody's design is a problem. Navigation is the problem. Every design is a problem if you don't navigate correctly. So, it's not about saying oh no, poor Bobby, always try to prove himself, all that stuff. No, there is a story here. This is what I want you to see. I want you to see that we all have this story.

I play with you about the concept of movie; I love the whole idea. I think it's perfect. It's a cheap rip-off of the Bard, but what do. The whole thing about the movie, the whole thing about scripts, is you need a story line. Without a storyline it's really boring. Every character has to have a storyline. Every character has to have a life. Regardless of what they play in the larger performance, there's a storyline.

This is your storyline. It's wonderful to see your storyline. And to see it within the context of that it is through this, on this storyline that your whole cognitive potential emerges. It's a wonderful thing to see. Once you're comfortable with that, once you're comfortable with isolating the Nodes in this way and looking at them this way and understanding what is going on in that construct, then you can look at the other side, then you can look at the Link Nodes.

### The Adjectives: The Backdrop of the Story Line

The adjectives* and how they work: if you take the two adjectives and bring them together, you get the backdrop of the story line. It's just there. And so out of that you build the movie. Remember that the backdrop carries all of the cognitive transposition and that means the storyline of the character has an intelligence to it. It's not just a story with dates, but it's a storyline that carries with it a cognitive quality, a cognitive approach, whatever the case may be. Again, it has to be seen in the context of the lines and the gates. What we're looking at is when you're just looking at the life story, we get a different configuration.

### The Link Nodes: The Inherent Intelligence

Everything about our lives is built on this track, everything about it. Remember that the Nodes are going to be part of the perspective that is going to be the framework for the way in which we're going to conceptualize. It means that perspective in and of itself has an inherent intelligence. It is this inherent intelligence that you get in the Link Nodes*. The non-Link Nodes* are going to give you the storyline, but the Link Nodes are going to give you the inherent intelligence at work. There is an intelligence to this character in its story. It is this intelligence that feeds this perspective.

Now again, what I do later today, experience is something that comes from the lunar and planetary square, but that experience takes place along the story, along the line of the story. Everything is about the story line. It's what gives us a life. Then you have to see how important it is--that question about what does life mean to you? Take your two Link Nodes together and synthesize them, because this is the intelligence behind the story.

It is funny how many things can be revealed. I don't think there's anything that can't be revealed. I think the maya is an open book. I think fundamentally you can see anything. It's just a matter of whether it's necessary, I guess, because it's all there. I don't want to be in a situation where I take you into these deep, deep minutiae and distort the overall process. _Advanced Mechanics_ in its own way is risky because I have many of these very, very subtle things to lay out because it's a responsibility to the science. Most of it is about inspiration, I think, because that really is what it's about.

_Written Comment: It feels like we were starting at the end of the story before, and only now are we getting to the beginning._

**Ra:** As Don just pointed out, we're at the closing little "this and that's" of major themes. These are minor themes in that sense. Mechanically speaking, interpretively it's only the beginning. To be able to find a way to integrate all of this knowledge, and I don't mean that in the sense of practical application of it like what we do with the CHD. I mean in the sense of building up a new way of looking at the holistic being from strictly a tonal point of view.

In other words, the way we've been looking at the bodygraph has gone from a line-to-a-line/color phenomenon, basically, with color taking on all of the values that we see in Rave Psychology and in PHS. But as we went deeper into the knowledge we saw that Tone was going to be _the_ thing, obviously, the left-ness and the right-ness and so forth, the cognition. I think it is possible, because I see it in my own way of looking at designs now, to begin a new way of looking at a being strictly through their cognitive framework, the way cognition work in them, and the way cognition works according to the dynamics of their AI chart, all on the surface.

There are so many fantastic things you can do with the surface with AI once you have all the inside data. Then this is possible. And I think it's important. The sev-en-centered being, when a child would come into the world, by the time it was through its first Saturn quarter, maybe seven years old, it would be told a story of the tribal past, the tribal history. It would be given its sense of continuity with the tribe's oral tradition.

I think by the time somebody is 15 years of age, approximately in the first half of the Saturn cycle, they're ready to be told their story line. Not about the past, but what lies ahead, not in the sense that it determines their life, but in the sense given they are correct in their process, it will allow them always to see as a signpost that they're on the right path, that they're moving in the right direction, that at all is well in the world.

### Seeing the Surface from the Cognition Point of View

I am very interested in building up this tonal centric surface, to see the surface from the point of view of cognition, not see it from the point of behavior or all the other things that we normally do. But simply look at it from the point of view of cognition and the potential inherent in any holistic life for awareness. What that quality awareness, based on the cognitive analysis rooted in the story line, would make for some interesting stuff. I guess we'll get there, somewhere down the road.

All right, I'm still not used to doing 90 minutes but anyway, I'm working on it in. I hope you enjoyed that. We have some wonderful material to cover in all of this. So, we'll keep at it. And to those of you I will see later, I won't be in the class until about five minutes before. This is a great doubleheader for those of you who are doing both because I have a fantastic _Personality Resonance_ coming. To those of you I won't see later, I'll see you next week. Until then, by for now.

 

## 11 **Lesson Five**

### 11 **Story Line and Cognitive Potential**

Welcome to all of you to part five in our Advanced Mechanics journey. I'm going to continue with this theme of the North and South Tone transposition. It is a subject that is going to take time to break down. But I want to give you the basic elements in a practical sense so you can begin to work with it.

### 11 **Link Nodes: The Instrument of Creating the Holistic Life**

One thing that is so interesting to me about Link Nodes, and I really don't know if I got that across the other day, is that it is very much unlike Tone, as an example, where the only way you can really see the impact of Tone on the surface is through layers of phenomena. But the interesting thing about the Link Nodes is that they give you an opportunity to look at the holistic being because that's what the Link Node does. It's actually the instrument of creating the holistic life. And as such in looking at them, obviously this is something you can evaluate immediately at the surface. It is something that is important.

### 11 **Variable**

The subtitle you see here--Story Line and Cognitive Potential--is actually part of the material I'm developing for the Variable workshops that I'm going to be doing in Ibiza. This is a very important event for me. I intend to give each Variable, in a sense, each person, a unique take, a unique way in which their Variable operates for them. This is really something that is accomplished through the North and South Tonal Transposition, through the story line and cognitive potential. I'll take you through this. It is a way of bringing the language to the independent Variable, the nodal direction of life, the external, in that sense.

### 11 **Link Nodes**I try not to belabor the point because it is clear to me that Variable is really, in so many ways, the culmination of the revelation of mechanics. Variable is really unbelievable. The deeper I look at it, the more extraordinary it is to me because it's so obvious that here, the plan, at an individual level, is laid out. It's not just a matter that you have a generic family; that is, the Variable whatever it is. Obviously 16 of them in seven billion people, we know that there are a lot of people in every Variable. It is about this incredible differentiation that exists in the mechanic of Design where we can break things down to this differentiated level.

But to give language to it--this is one of the things that I'm always concerned about in terms of one of my goals for _Advanced Mechanics:_ to provide language for very, very difficult concepts for newcomers to grasp. What you have been taught by me in relationship to the values of the Design external or Personality external--though there are keynotes that provide entry doors for somebody who doesn't know this and ways for you to be able to guide them to it--it's still something that is broken down into this side and that side. And so it should.

In other words, one is PHS and one is Rave Psychology. Regardless of the fact that there is Link Node connection to them and so forth, the only way you can see them holistically is within the context of the bodygraph, within the nature of their role. And then we're bringing something very different. In a way, what we're looking at is this: you have the Design external on one side, you have the Personality external on the other side and then in between you have the story. This is really what it is all about. In other words, this is where you get to see how those two things come together in something greater. It's very similar to the way in which we look at a channel.

### The Life Force of the Independent Variable

In a sense, the story line and the cognitive potential is the life force of the independent Variable. It is the life force and it is the life force given a costume. And it's not this or that. The Link Nodes make sure of it. It's not this or that. It's not the Design or the Personality and the way in which they work within their own particular agendas. No, no, no. This is where everything gets jumbled up. The Link Nodes crossing over and all of a sudden we have a holistic mechanism, a whole that's greater than the sum of the parts, the juxtaposition that gives us the story of the independent Variable. This is what we want to know.Think about the independent Variable. Think about what it really is. There are certain things that we understand are a fundamental about the independent Variable. What we know about it is that this literally is where the life takes place. This is where we get into action. This is where the motion is, this is where the navigation is, this is where truly the form principle lives out whatever its orientation is intended to be. In other words, that is its natural state.

We're nine-centered beings, we are Uranian beings. We have a Uranian body with an expectation of 84 years minimum, of well-being with proper quality of life because that's the kind of body we have. Now, we know that body only receives its nourishment from the external, separate from what PHS dietary regimen does for the internal. This is the other side of the dualistic coin. The outside nourishment that's necessary is the environmental nourishment.

### The PHS Side of the Independent Variable

So what we get to understand on the PHS side in terms of the independent Variable, this is where we create the orientation towards a healthy, long lifestyle. And of course, that means that environment nurtures not simply our process in life, but it nurtures more importantly who we get to meet in this life. Everything about the movement we're going to have along the track of the independent Variable is going to be conditioned by how the overall frequency of the being operates. In other words, is the frequency dysfunctional?

If are we dealing with the not-self, then we don't have to concern ourselves with the nuances of this subject. But the moment we're dealing with somebody who is operating according to the Strategy and Authority, they are already aligning themselves to proper navigation. It isn't necessarily perfected, but it is a process along with their deconditioning, to move them in the right direction.

### The Personality Side of the Independent Variable

One of the things we get to see when we move over to the Rave Psychology side, to the Personality side is that the external is the platform for mind. It is the thing that makes it so extraordinary. Remembering that the Sun/Earth, the Personality internal, is a performance mechanism. This is where the style and the delivery of mind, where the conceptualizing of it takes place, but the way the material is organized is through the framework of perspective.

When you're looking at an AI chart, the first thing to understand when you're looking on the Personality side, just to keep it easy, if you're looking at the lunar and planetary square, you're looking at the way in which we take in experience, the material that the mind ultimately is going to work with. When we're looking at the independent Variable and the Personality external, we're looking at the framework through which this experience is taken in. If you don't take the experience in the way it was intended to be taken in, then you don't get any of the values from it.

Yes, it is extraordinary that the lunar and planetary square is our mechanism for experiencing life, and yet in order for us to be perfected in our uniqueness, that experience of life has to go through a correct frame. What you experience is where you are and what you see. Where you are and what you see is the independent Variable. What we know about seeing is that it has its own dilemmas because it is constantly being teased by distraction. In other words, the harmonic movement that we call transference at the Personality Sun/Earth level, here this is distraction constantly trying to pull the perception away from what is correct.

So we know that we have two sides of the coin. We know on one side that we have an environmental demand that brings certain benefits. We know on the other side we have a Personality demand that is the correct perception or view that is going to bring its benefits. But what does that mean as a life? That's what we're looking at. That's what we're here to see and that's what we're here to see over here _[lower circled area]_.

I've given you one of those examples where you don't have the duplication of the Nodes. And of course, I don't know--again Adrian thanks for today--I don't know about the statistics of that, quite frankly. I don't know how many people have the same gates for their Design and Personality Nodes and how many people have different. For example, I have different ones.

_Adrian: 25.50% the same._

**Ra:** Interesting--in other words, showing up in charts, right? I don't get that, but anyway, all right. You'll have to explain that to me because I don't understand the context. If the same were 25% of the time and different were 25% of the time, what's the rest? There is no rest. I don't understand. Ok, I'll move on for now.

_Adrian: 25.50 % of all charts have the north and south nodes in the same gates, respectively._

**Ra:** Ok, thank you. I see.

So, the solution is that what we need is a life force. In the same way that a channel gives us an opportunity to see the way the gates at either end, that are very different coming from each other, coming from very different centers, with very different ways in which they operate, that somehow they come together in a holistic function.

So, here we're dealing with the same thing but we're dealing with it at another level. In other words, what we're looking at now is the possibility of going beyond what we've taken in in PHS and Rave Psychology as these separate functions and begin to give it a holistic value. In other words, to begin to give it a language that we can look at, and of course, this language is going to be the by-product of the tonal transposition.

### Tonal Transposition

Let's go back to our theme of tonal transposition and see if we can work that one out. Personality Link Node, here it is, and you can see the Personality Link Node with its Base orientation and again you see the Base orientation here and you can see the Personality Link Node is now brought over to the other side. You can see that it's moved from a 6 to a 1. In other words, the tonal transposition has taken place.

The other thing is, and again, I'll remind you about how you use this. You don't use this information in the same way. The next thing is we look at the Design Link Node. You can see the Base orientation is the 5 _[black arrow]_. Obviously, it doesn't belong here. It belongs over here where it is the centerpiece of this _[blue arrow]_ and of course, the 59.4 goes down here _[orange arrow]_. And we see that this is moving from a 1 to a 6 _[green arrow]_ in terms of the tonal transposition.

 
I did that fast, I hope that was ok and you got that. At first it can seem confusing. It confused me at times; particularly when you're looking at the two and you're trying to work it out because it's an odd way to see the Nodes. Again, it's very straightforward in the way in which the mechanism operates. We're just crossing them over and in doing so what you're looking for is obviously the change that's going to take place tonally.

So here we have the transposition that has taken place and the background of this--because again remember, one of my goals today is to give you a way to try to bring your PHS and Rave Psychology independent Variable knowledge to the surface so that you can actually bring it to the charts that you look at. It is one of the things that the more familiar you are with that--I'm teaching you basic nine-centered sootshaying. That's really what it is. It's a way of being able to see the story line and the quality of the character of that story line. But anyway, we'll get there.

The first thing we have to consider here--and again, we're looking at the independent Variable--we can see that we have four different variations here. The other thing to notice about it is that here is the 29, here is the 59, and of course, here is the 30 and here is the 55 side-by-side over here _[gates circled in the bodygraph]_. So you can see that everything that is here in the independent Variable is alive and well in this single definition emotional Generator.

In other words, everything about the way in which this is going to work is so easy. All you have to do is be a good emotional Generator. I don't know how easy that is. I've learned that Generators for some reason or another have a hard time with the purely simple. But anyway, you can see that obviously, in terms of any interpretation tion, having all of the elements part of a single definition just happens to be the re-rendipity of this chart. It certainly allows, in terms of any kind of analysis, a very clear key to the way this works.

Often you have situations where elements of the independent Variable are either split off from each other, or you have an element in an open center that is a hanging gate, or many that are hanging gates, or all that are hanging gates. There are many possible configurations for the way in which the Nodes are actually going to function in terms of the chart. Over the next several classes I will be showing you different variations so I will give you different ideas on the way that operates.

This is just graphically showing you that shift of the 6 to the 1 on the Design side and again with the north, the same phenomena. In other words, moving from the 1 where that Design North Node used to be over here and moving over here so that you pick up the 6 so you get to that side. What I want to do today in the time we have is to give you an analytical formula.

### An Analytical Formula: The Story Line

So, this is your analytical formula. First of all, let's be clear about the way in which this works. The story line is what does **not** link. In other words, it is those nodal aspects that are not Link Nodes. They don't go here and they don't go in here _[red X's]_. That's where the story line is. This is the fixed story line that is there for the life.

Remember what you're looking at. Remember the context. See it within its environmental context, within its perspective context. It's laying the foundation for what the story line for this being _could_ be; could be. This is always the question mark. When I look at somebody's Nodes and they're not-self, I'm not even interested, because what to do? The Nodes represent the refinement of a process. You get to see this in the way the child is naturally raised in this knowledge, the way they're intended to progress, this natural progression that is intended to be there.

When you're looking at that progression, what you get to see is that environment is something you wait 30 years, approximately until the first Saturn, until that becomes something that is important and you begin to set yourself in the correct environment. It's a 20 year process to develop the perception of all of that. So it's something to understand about the not-self and what I'm showing you here.This is not a not-self story line. There will be elements in it, obviously, because it's on the surface. These are Nodes; they're in the design. But you're dealing with a homogenized personality. And you're dealing with a mind that is making decisions, so obviously, you're not going to have the right cognition. You're not going to have the right perception. You're not going to be in the right place, so the story line is not one that is easy to read, because it doesn't really work.

In other words, what you're looking at here is part of my long-term involvement with the development of the knowledge that is the foundation of the Center for Human Differentiation. That is, the areas I am developing in _Advanced Mechanics_ are areas that are going to benefit the holistic work that we do with those who enter into the experiment.

This story line is basically a signpost structure. In other words, by looking at these things in terms of what is possible, in terms of looking at what the differentiated possibility is, that opens up the whole opportunity for the growing awareness of mind to watch their story line and see the reference points to the signposts. So I don't want you to assume, the kind of assumption that people made about Incarnation Crosses, "Oh ge gee, this is my cross so this is me." Well, yeah, we all know, sort of dysfunctionally, but it isn't what it means to live on your cross. It doesn't have anything to do with it. It's just a very, very attractive keynote.

But to live out fully what your cross is all about, you have to be absolutely correct and aware, because that's what it's for. Then you get to live out the differentiated nuance of that. Otherwise a cross is just another generic. There are millions of Clarions alive on the earth today--I'm a Clarion--millions of them today. They don't do my job. Some of them are doing Clarion work. Most of them are yelling a lot. That's a joke; but anyway, nobody's listening.

### Tonal Transposition Brings a Way Design and Personality Can Align

Ok, the other side of the coin is what makes tonal transposition so interesting. What do we know about the external? On the PHS side, when we look at the external, we know that the body in its most general keynote is active or it's passive. And we know that the active or passive is something that is determined by the tonal quality. So obviously, tonal transposition, when it comes to the physical side, is something that is very interesting. Because as you can see, and again, it's not always going to be the case. I know that the question arises: is there a difference between 1, 2, and 3, and 4, 5 and 6? No, there isn't. As a matter of fact, this is about the line that runs through the middle of the little triangle. In other words, this is simply about left-ness and right-ness.

Basically what it's doing is adapting the potential of the perspective to the right physicality of the body. In other words, it's honing it in to the instrument. It's sort of like focusing the camera, because that's basically what it's doing. Without the Link Node, it doesn't have the proper frequency. That is, the Personality is not going to be in synch in the way in which the body operates. The Personality and its perspective isn't necessarily going to be in synch with the way in which the visual cortex works.

So it's very, very important to understand what tonal transposition brings. It brings a way in which both the Design and Personality can align to the other side. This is what makes it pure holistic. As a matter of fact, it is more deeply holistic as a juxtaposition and as a life force than the story line itself because here we're dealing exclusively with the Link Nodes.

### Tone Infuses Everything with Cognitive Potential

Cognitive potential: think about what this really means. This is not an intelligence in the way we understand it as an expressed intelligence. It goes back to the role playing. You have a lunar and planetary square where experience takes place. All of that experience, whatever it may be and whatever aspect of the experience, in fact, it's this nine-block magic square. Whatever is part of this experiential taking-in that is ultimately going to be of service to the Personality has to be taken in through this. Which means there is an intelligence in the way in which our body aligns us to the way we need to see.

Remember what we're dealing with. We're dealing with Tone. Tone infuses everything with cognitive potential. So what that means is that the moment you're aligned correctly, the moment your orientation is correct, the moment you're there in the environment with the right perspective, you have a flood of cognitive potential that is part of the way you live out your story. Because it's the way in which the depth at which the nuance of which you're going to be taking things in.

So, we have these two aspects. When you go over to the Personality side, you can see that what has happened here to the Node _[Design North Node]_ that was over here _[red X]_, is the way the Design is going to operate in its future--88 of the Sun difference. It's an interesting thing to think about. The way in which it's going to be able to use what it's taking in _[Tone 6]_, because that's basically what this is about, how do you use what you've taken in? And of course, the way you can use it is going to be determined by whether it's going to be strategic or it's going to be receptive; whether it is going to be peripheral or it's going to be focused is more accurate.

Here you can see that it's going to be peripheral, that it needs to work peripherally. Otherwise, it wouldn't work. So, this is allowing a cognitive flow of information to go back and forth across this. And it's going back and forth across this through the agency of the Magnetic Monopole with its attraction frequency, capture frequency. So here we are held together, and layered on top of that is our story. What we bring to our story is our cognitive potential. And it says a lot.The Design of the Cognitive Potential: The 30.6

SeeingI talk a lot about seeing and this is where seeing take place. But we all see differently. And even though our perspective, as we know, is framed within what is, in fact, six basic possibilities, each of those six basic possibilities have hundreds if not thousands of variations. Think about this one in this particular case. In this particular case, let's begin with looking at the Design of our cognitive potential. What we know about the design of the cognitive potential is that we're dealing with the 30th gate. We have the South Node in the 30th gate of desire. It's a gate of fates, the Clinging Fire, and the 6th line, Enforcement, _the discipline to maintain right action_ and the discipline to maintain right action with a very active* connection to that.

In other words, when this person is correct, they are rigidly correct. _An assertiveness to purge the inferior while accepting to lead the weak._ We're beginning to get the way in which this seeing is going to work, to look for things, to be able to see things that are going to be a benefit to others, the strength to eliminate negative feelings. There are all kinds of things that are here that become part of the way in which the cognitive potential is going to operate.

Remember, this is the physical side. And as the physical side, we have to see that we're dealing with certain things. For example, we are dealing with the influence of what it is to be 6, what it is to be not designed to pay attention to what is really around you but to see beyond, so you know that the cognitive potential being guided by that 6th line is really looking off into things. You have somebody who isn't particularly focused on seeing things to resolve them in the moment. It's not there. It's looking beyond. And it's looking filled with a desire and a desire that is deeply active.



### 4.2.1 Total Transposition of the 55 Gate Design South Node

This is somebody who carries nodally the 55/59. We know, obviously, that this _[gate 55]_ is under deep mutative pressure. We know this is a deeply individual gate to begin that. That abundance is the cup that is half-full and half-empty. It is unconscious. It is not who this person thinks they are. They're very connected to who they think are and who they think they are takes on a different nature when they are aware. Think about that.

It's one of the most fantastic things to understand about tonal transposition because it's a great signpost. All of you have noticed in your process the way you look at things, the way you think; these are things that change in this process. Look at the tonal transposition here. The Personality, who you think you are, is now connected to the body, isn't it? It isn't connected to anything else, but it's connected to the external of the design. This is something that is deeply, deeply, deeply important. So there can be, for a human being, true identification with where they are and how important that is. This is something for us to understand about giving external knowledge to people, they're waiting for it.

Ok, the other side is the 59.4. This 55-59 opposition, obviously the 59 gate is also going to be under extraordinary pressure. Again, you're dealing with an emotional aspect which is part of the emotional authority. It means that it's going to be very difficult for this person to keep their vision correct if their emotional system does not operate correctly. It is their authority. That patience is going to be the only way they're going to find the ability to be able to truly drop their barriers.

### 4.2.2  

 It's interesting in the line 59.4, brotherhood/sisterhood, that we have moved over to the peripheral. It's much more open, very, very open to looking out, but looking out in a very, very human way. You're dealing with the 59th gate. This is a genetic role gate. So the cognitive potential here is very much connected with the other, very much connected with seeing the inferior in the other and working with that. In other words, this is going to establish very profoundly the way in which the ultimate view is going to work because it is bringing all of these deeper qualities to the superficial keynote of whatever the particular view happens to be.

### Cognitive Potential is Tonal--Story Line is Shaped by Color

You notice that I'm not getting into that now because I want you to see this so clearly: Cognitive Potential is Tonal. Story line is dominated by Color. Of course, this is where you see the differences in these two aspects. I truly love being the dualist. I don't think there is anything more perfect than being a dualist. Here you see the magic of nodal duality. Not simply the Link Nodes and the way in which they create the holistic life, but also understand that the Nodes themselves, in this breakup between the cognitive potential and the story line of the external, we also get to see the separate influence of Tone along with the separate influence of Color.

Now remember, this does not reflect back on looking just at the Design or just at the Personality; remember that. What we're looking at here is a holistic phenomenon. What we see here within this holistic phenomenon can only be interpreted within this construct. You can't bring this back to the individual analysis of either the Design side or the Personality side. This only emerges holistically. So for example when you're doing basic PHS or Rave Psychology and you're talking about the external, you're talking about the values you've been taught relative to Tone and Color. But you can see that the moment you step into the holistic, there is a division in the way that actually works. But the tonal influence is about the cognitive potential and the color influence, the view, is all about the story line.

That story line is something that is going to be built on a specific environment with a specific view. There is no transposition, as you can see; it is just straightforward. But it's so important to understand how the story line is specifically shaped by Color. And that the story line is, in essence, the dependent of the independent cognitive, if I can put it that. I don't mean to confuse you, but I want you to have a sense that it's built on this because this is what holds us together _[Cognitive Potential]_ and this is how we can live it out _[The Story Line]_.But what we live out is based on the fact that it's being held together with a cognitive purpose, after all. Everything about us, the illusion of Tone that is in every body-graph you look at; it's there. This cognitive potential is everything for us. And through the agency of the Monopole, through the G Center, this cognitive potential sets the standard; the story comes on top.

## Appendix A 20 Year Story Line

Now, the story is what most people are interested in. What's going to happen to me? That kind of thing, that kind of story. But what we understand about the external is that it is not the story line of the life. It's not. It is a 20 year it's like the Bhagavad Gita or one of those ancient Indian books, and they made it into a movie. I think it lasted like 10 days or something. It went on forever. This is basically a 20 year story line, to be accurate. This is basically what it is.

Again, remember the development of children. By the way, coming up after _The Mechanics of the Maya_ series that I'm doing now on Jovian TV, I'm doing something called _The School of Enlightened Selfishness_. I start filming them next week or the week after. The first three are examinations of the true nine-centered life. So, I'm going to do a birth to Saturn, a Saturn to Kiron, and a Kiron beyond, and lay out formally the dynamics of the true nine-centered life.

Of course, we're all conditioned beings who have been deconditioned, so we don't have that pattern where we have the first 30 years to develop our natural identity relative to our type and our authority and to have the proper PHS and food regimen. And then we get to the Saturn and that's when all of this becomes important. It's only when you get to the Saturn. And of course, this story here about the development of the cognitive potential relative to environment and perspective goes as far as Kiron. That's the way it's meant to be. That's this story. Afterwards, the flowering of Kiron doesn't follow a formula. It's guided by, supposedly, according to the way this program opens up, should be guided by differentiated unique awareness. One does not know what that leads to. This is where this story is built.

What does that mean for us? All of us are basically in that story. If I think of myself, because I'm the oldest student of Human Design. I'm in my 21st year headed towards, very soon, my 22nd anniversary. Theoretically, I suppose, I am in my flowering. I managed to get through the 20 years. I think we all have to keep in mind that this story line for us is very important because it gives us the story line relative to our Variable and relative to what is possible, particularly for those of you who are so deep in this particular process.

### The Example: The 55.4

All right, let me give you a brief example here of how this looks. Let's take a look at that 55. In looking at the 55 it's a 4th line, it's _Assimilation_. We know very clearly the importance of the market, the environment, all of the things that come with the knowledge environmentally. Something to understand about the story line, it's the story line. It says: _The establishment of a framework that balances principles with energy and leads inevitably to expansion and prosperity. The possible spirit that comes when emotional awareness and energy are balanced and principled_. And it's about _boundless energy_ and all of these things. It's about assimilating.

The story of this person's life is trying to find those beings that it can feel good with. It's its story line, and it means that looking for those beings is something so important to it. Now, we know it's already built in. We know the cognitive potential is about being very aware of the inferior, of enforcing principles. It's about brotherhood and sisterhood and yet it has the dynamics of what it is looking for. The cognitive potential is oriented towards the other. You come to the 55 and the individual romantic passion that is there, all kinds of qualities that are there.

Here is somebody where it is really going to be a passion for them to find the right people. Think about how devastating that's going to be if you're not-self. You're not going to find the right people. If your story line is to find the right people, you better find them, because this is how you're going to live out your purpose. The only way you're going to live out your purpose and live out your cross is if you're living your story.

## The Underlying Theme of What the Story Will Be Built On

Understand this concept or this keynote of story line. I like to attach things to my movie metaphor. I want you to be very careful in understanding this: There is no script here. We know that the script is in all of the lines. This story line is that we're looking at the underlying theme of what the story will be built on. Remember that.

Again, we've deconstructed. Here particularly, we're looking at a very, very deconstructed area. See what this story line is really about it. It is setting the thematic atmosphere for the correct life, that thematic atmosphere of bringing your cognitive gift that arises in the right environment with the right perspective to be able to find those beings you can assimilate with, those beings who are going to enrich your life as you enrich theirs and bring success.

Without the assimilation it doesn't work. Here is somebody, that within their design, they are a 59/6, 40/37 two of the three social channels. The 40/37, the channel of Community and Assimilation. All of those things are deeply integrated into their design. To look at this person on the surface is very simple for me because I know the one thing that is getting in the way is their emotional system. It's a very, very powerful emotional system. It's very easy for that emotional system to absolutely distort this life. You have somebody with a totally open G Center, so they're very, very vulnerable at the identity level. It's very easy for them to be overwhelmed emotionally.

Again, there are so many factors in what brings perfection into a life. That 55.4, again we have to see that from the physical point of view. This person needs to be in that environment where assimilation is going to take place. Yet, at the same time, they have to be physically healthy which means that their dietary regimen is very, very important to them. All of these things come into place because we see here in the story line that Color is very, very important.The Personality North Node 29.6 Story Line

When we go to the 29th gate on other side, we're dealing with: _The deep within the Deep;_ the gate of saying "yes," a Personality that is embracing. But it's also _The Abysmal_ and the 6th line is _Confusion: The state that exists when momentum outstrips awareness_. I love lines like that. If you have a line like that you think, "Oh shit, what am I going to do with that?" I love those kinds of lines because they're the best jokes of all. You never get the joke itself until you live it, until you have one of those lines and you get to see the way it works when it's meant to work correctly.

And oh yes, this is somebody in which that view is going to be very confused. They're going to see a lot of different possibilities, a lot of different possibilities of people. But remember, the story line doesn't have to design what you do with that. It just means that this person's mind, the way in which that Personality Sun/Earth is going to operate, the way they conceptualize, that's where the responsibility is to deal with what the peripheral has brought them.

You can see that the approach is going to be very, very deep because it carries a fear mechanism with it. So it really is something in which you have somebody whose whole life is going to be directed towards assimilating, but what they get to see, they never really get to see who is precisely for them; not here.

Remember back to the 30 in the 6th line, that cognitive potential never really gets to see what's right in its face. It's looking further down the road. It means that if the cognitive potential is right, and obviously the whole decision making process is inherently correct, then that will work for them because they're here to assimilate, not to be picky. They're here to be able to find a way to assimilate with everyone, inferior or not.

### The Design is Always Going To Tell the Story

We all have this road map that becomes a perfection the moment we are correct in the way we operate from the physical side, because in the end, that's where it all comes from. It comes from the physical side. The Design is always going to tell the story. It's always going to tell the story if you have a chance. This is something that really needs to be understood about us. When I say "us," I'm speaking about those who have been conditioned and have been deconditioned. There is no rule. You can achieve the highest level of differentiation that's possible for you and not do certain things. You simply won't have the advantage they bring. But then again, it isn't necessarily designed for you to have such an advantage.

### You Cannot Compare Yourself with Anybody Else

You have to see that you're already very, very fortunate to be able to decondition at any level. The percentage of human beings who can truly become aware, I don't want to tell you the numbers because they're tiny. It's in the millions, small millions in billions and billions of human beings, because it's quite a journey to get there. So, it's one of the things that I have to caution you. It is so tempting to want to be aware, isn't it? All these transformations, all the possibilities. I'm a 5 after all; I know the power of seduction. You have to be very clean with yourself in all of these things and you cannot compare yourself with anybody else. You cannot.

Somebody who achieves extraordinary transformation through PHS and somebody else who achieves it through some other aspect, it's not about comparing anybody. You can't, because there are no rules for us. There isn't, there can't be. The rules exist for those who are coming into the world, those many Design babies that are in the world now who have the great gift of having parents who are aware, at least aware to the point of understanding their responsibility to their child to give them the best possible start in this life. That's who this is for. For them, they don't have to worry about environment. They have 30 years before they have to worry about such things. Worry isn't even the word. We have to worry about all of it because we're always catching up. And of course, this is where the pressure is.

### Everybody's Process is Unique: You Need Your Own Signposts

To really get into the ability to be able to see the signpost of what is there in your external, you need to be sensitive. Some people cannot find that sensitivity without the benefit of PHS, the cognitive sensitivity. It is something to understand that all of these things, the advantage you get by gaining this knowledge, is so you can see it as a signpost of your own process, because that's what is good for. That's what all the mechanics are good for, to allow you, because you're alone. There is nobody who says, "Oh, great you're doing terrific." They can't say that, because everybody's journey is their own journey, everybody's process in Human Design is unique. You need your own signposts.

As you develop your own authority, you also need those signposts because they bring you something essential to your life. It's call self-love. The saddest thing we have on this planet is that there is such a dearth of self-love. Without self-love there is no trust. Without trust you cannot meet the world. This is everything for us.

### Inner Authority

I don't want anyone who is involved in this process to feel less love for themselves because they're not doing this or that or the other thing; it's nonsense. You do what you do according to your inner authority. You do it or not according to your inner authority. If your inner authority says, "I don't want to pay attention to any of this," it's ok. It's what your inner authority is telling you. It's not about anybody has the right to say to you, are you sure? Oh we forget; inner authority, everybody has their inner authority.

What you will do in this life is there to be determined by that inner authority. Do not for a moment take what I teach you as a pressure that you do this. I don't care. I have never cared. I can't. It would drive me crazy if I had to care about all of you. It's not about that; it's your trip. And it's the thing that we have to see about the integrity of your trip. It doesn't matter whether you go this way or that way in Human Design. It only matters how you go. If you go according to your inner authority, you go with what is correct for you.

Every single one of us has an authority inside of us that will tell us honestly what we can and cannot do at any given time. Trust it. We can teach all of these things. They're wonderful, they're interesting, they're all that stuff, but Strategy and Authority, I don't care how smart you are in Human Design, Strategy and Authority is what it's all about. That's the only thing that brings you to that place where you can trust yourself, where you can love yourself and you can watch the movie. Humanity is tormented by the movie.

I saw a statistic today. Two-thirds of Americans are deeply pessimistic right now, even though they've had an exhilarating moment, they're pessimistic about the economy, things like that. The world just rides up and down on the program stuff. Those human beings who are afraid for their jobs, for their security, for all of those things, and I do feel for them, but they're caught in the greatest pain that the not-self brings, the turmoil of what their mind is going to put them through, the anxiety, the fears, the suffering, all of it. They're barely alive. Some of them get so despereate they kill themselves. They're just barely alive. No one can live like this.

If you live by your own authority, it doesn't matter what this and that is. Your survival on this plane is guaranteed when you know how to act on this plane. You don't need anybody else to help you. It doesn't matter whether we're talking about economies or not. It doesn't matter whether we're talking about jobs or this or that or the other thing. It doesn't make any difference. Nobody operates a business like I do; I know that because it's so bizarre. But I'm a freak and I follow my authority and I do what I do. And I don't worry about this or that. I don't have to.

## 11 When You're Correct You Can Just Sit and Watch

When you're correct you can just sit and watch. It doesn't matter whether it looks like things are going down the drain or not. There's nothing to do. You're not going to chase after it. There's nothing to do. Human beings don't know what it means to be truly **un**afraid, because they don't trust themselves. They have nothing to trust. They're looking for somebody to help them, they're looking for somebody to save them, they're looking for somebody to give them, because they can't look in the mirror and see that they are the answer. They're the only answer to their life.

More than any other professionals in Human Design, we are here to make sure that the integrity of inner authority is grasped as deeply as possible, what this means to be your own authority. Until you live it, until you have those moments in your life where you deal with crisis and this and that and you live it through this, only then do you begin to understand you're ok. The world can go to hell and a hand basket; you're ok. And you will be ok, because you rule your own life.

I look out in the world and it's so sad. I think it's beautiful that the Americans, with-in the context of their society, that they were able to do that. Yet, at the same time, this is the homogenized world. This poor man has a whole planet waiting for him to deliver the goods, as if nobody can deliver their own. As if he is going to make it all better.

The insanity of this planet is that everybody is waiting for somebody in some far off place who doesn't know who the hell you are, doesn't really care, to do a job that supposedly is going to make a difference for you and you're going to wait. People do this at every level in their lives, every, every single level in their lives. Think about it. How many authorities human beings have, how many people tell human beings what to do, how many human beings can't get up in the morning without needing somebody to guide them? So you have to be very careful.

Somebody who is truly experimenting with Human Design, who is operating out of their inner authority, it does not matter what anything theoretically brings. It does not mean that this is on their agenda. Like anything else for them in this life, it has to be correct. They have to enter into it correctly and only then is it ok. If they don't, there is nothing wrong. There isn't. I consider any human being who experiments with Strategy and Authority, even though they don't stay there, is an extraordinary example of humanity. Truly, I do. Now, what it takes to get to that place. It's not an easy thing to break out of the homogenized grasp. It's not an easy thing to grow up in a world where your yearning, because there's something not right, is embraced by others. So, the integrity of inner authority is an important movie.

All right, story line, cognitive potential--I'll go through a series of these to give you some basic ideas about the way in which it works. I want you to slowly begin to work with this so that when you're looking from the deep level, you see. Because you look at such a deep level in both PHS and Rave Psychology, you're also able to bring this up to the surface and begin to understand the way seeing this on the surface gives you a real understanding of what's holding this life together. Remember, this is the point here. The story line and the cognitive potential is holding the lifetogether. So, everything comes out of this. That's the thing that is so incredible about the independent Variable.

All right, as I said, I wanted to give you a chance to ask me some questions. So I will open it up to you and away we go.

## Q & A

### The Phases of the 6th Line: The Environment is their Roof

_Kumud:_ Just in terms of this example, it happens in my own design also, one of the _Nodes is a 6th line. I know you haven \(t\) been talking about the 6th line, but when you read the 30 line 6, what about the 3rd line phase for the first 28 years. Does that figure?

**Ra:** It's an interesting point. The 3rd line phase is always buried somewhere inside of any 6. But it isn't really there unless it's associated with the Sun/Earth. Again, as I said, in terms of the natural life of a nine-centered being, it is not something that would take effect until they are already back in the 6th line phase, which also tells you something about how important it is to wait until you're 30 before you enter into your environment. In essence, for the 6th line being, truly the environment is their roof.

### Is Distraction Important Before the Saturn Return?

_Question:_ I got kicked out of the class and I think you were talking about some classes you were going to do about childhood development. But I am a little confused in terms of factors not to mention to people until they're 28-30 years of age. Would you not work with distraction until somebody is past Saturn? And does it mean before 28-30 years they just muddle along with not much distraction, if they happen to be brought up correctly?

**Ra:** The joke is that it makes absolutely no difference because it is not the point until they get to their Saturn. That's the thing that's so interesting. In other words, for example, I talked about this in terms of the environment. Both my sons, for example, are mountain and I'm shores and my partner is shores, and we don't live on a mountain. As a matter of fact, we're pretty close to sea level, obviously, being on an island. But this is not detrimental to them at all. As a matter of fact, it doesn't figure in whatsoever because it doesn't kick in until they're going to be 30.

In other words, it's an interesting thing to see about the way the program is, is that the program, in terms of a nine-centered being, is only interested in the basic cognitive development. PHS dietary regimen, so you have a seven-year neural development, and the Strategy and Authority, and being treated according to your type, obviously, so that you are operating at an incredibly healthy and acute level. The fact that there is going to be distraction is going to be natural. In other words, there is going to be a natural distraction, but it will not be more powerful than the view because, again, you're dealing with somebody who is operating correctly from the time they're born.

So, it's not like these things are going to malfunction. They just don't have any value until that time of life and then it has value. That's the thing that makes the nine-centered being so interesting and different from us in terms of us being conditioned beings, different from the way in which we're trying to tackle all of these deconditioning processes.

### Distraction from the 1st Line to the 4th Line in a Child

_Question: Well, I was working with a 60 year-old guy on deconditioning distraction. I haven't quite absorbed this information yet. And I wonder if it was relevant to say that as a 1st Color distraction--he was distracted to needs. I wonder if his childhood was full of trying to take care of the needs of his mother because it looks like that, but I think that there is no impact like that in childhood is what you're saying._

**Ra:** Exactly. There is no impact like that because it's not the point. It's one of my jokes about the coming raves. Somebody asked about their religiosity or their whatever and I said God won't even be a question for them simply because it's not built into their design. It's built into ours; it's not built into theirs.

Again, it is about seeing the mechanisms. It is clear that you cannot develop cognitive potential, your real cognitive potential, you cannot embrace your story line until you're operating according to Strategy and Authority and are on the right dietary regimen, at least in terms of the way the program unfolds.

## A Question on the Story Line and Cognitive Potential

_Question: Please Ra, can you make it clearer by repeating once more. Did I understand it right that if the South Nodes are dominant for the first half of life and the North Nodes for the second half of life, then the story line gets its importance, its fulfillment in the Personality side in the second half of the life, and the cognitive potential develops from the Personality to the Design and thus from the conscious to the unconscious side?_

**Ra:** Well, we're looking at two things. Basically, the South Node/North Node phenomena that you're referring to, you see in the story line. In other words, that's the general way in which we have been looking at going back to the earliest years of the study of the Nodes, that you're moving from that South Node to the North Node, so you see that in the story line. It's the same thing you would have seen in the chart before you knew all this.What's different here, obviously, is the dividing up of the external into its two different parts. What emerges is that difference that is there through the Link Nodes and the cognitive potential. But the value of the South Node being an early theme and the North Node being a later theme as generalized themes, this is still valid within the context of the story line. So, that dynamic need for assimilation is going to be very much a part of the early part of the life where the confusion is going to come later.

If that was the development of this person's cognitive possibilities as a correct ninetementered being from birth, that would mean from the time of 30 to 50, they would go through this movement where the first part was still focused on assimilating and the second part would lead to the confusion. This would lay the foundation for the conceptual flowering. So, yes it's still there; but, we have another level that we're looking at that's below that surface.

### A Question on Cognitive Potential

_Question:_ _In terms of this example, Ra, where we have the tonal transposition of the left and right, do they carry equal value for that cognitive potential?_

**Ra:**: Yes, they do because they're really very primitive switches. One of the things to try to grasp about this mechanism is it's a really ancient mechanism, it's a bedrock in the way in which everything works. It's only after things were pulled together that the biology could begin, if you know what I mean. This is really quite a phenomenal thing. So, you're looking at something that is very deep. Maybe you want to rephrase the question based on that, I don't know.

_Comment:_ _No, that was sufficient for now, thank you._

_Question:_ _I would like to piggy back on that question, because last week you had an example where the body was right tonal and it picked up a left tonal from the Personality side and you mentioned a correctness that would be a very calm body. I couldn't quite understand; logically, I didn't understand when you mix a bit of active with passive you get super-passive. I know that's horrendously simple, but could you explain that again?_

**Ra:**: Ok, let's see what I can do with it over here. Let's take the example over here because I think today I articulated that much better than I did the other day. Again, it's my process of going through these things openly for the first time.

Let's take the situation here where we have the movement that's gone over from the 6 to the 1. That is, in this particular case in that sense that we've gone over to the active. Again, because this is a very primitive switch--left or right--the only key notes that matter are the simplest, or the most basic, in this case the active and the passive. Because we're dealing with a basic split in the triangle, there are in fact nuances here. Not nuances that we would read as tonal values, but nuances in the sense of the way in which the active body is going to be active, what level of activity it's going to have. In other words, it can be modestly active to moderately active to very active, as an example.

Now, my comment the other day was that because the body is able to tune into that sense of what is necessary for the Personality, that the more correct you are, the more it's going to hone in to a very, very specific activity frequency. The other day was the other way around. And of course, the other way around was I was talking about the calmness coming in. It had moved to the right. It's the same kind of thing; there are different levels of passive in the same way there are different frequencies for active.

Basically what I was trying to say is that the moment you're really correct, the moment you're really honed in, your body is going to take exactly what it has to have, exactly that frequency in order for you to take in in that way. It's something you're really going to notice, because it's a very specific frequency within the range, as I said.

For example, those people who have experimented with their Strategy and Authority but nothing further, there is going to be a lot of fluctuation in whether they're passive or active to the level of the passive or active simply because this is something that fluctuates relative to the world around it, because that's what the external brings to us. The thing to notice is that it's going to change the physical frequency. And change it in that subtle sense of honing it in and locking it into something.

### The Emanation Coming From Nodal Connectedness with People

_Question: So I know this diagram doesn't involve the Sun/Earth, but if this person, for example, had a right-fixed body from the Sun/Earth point of view and doesn't have the left-fixed body, what's the difference between the emanation coming off--you walk into a bar and you meet this person and this person has a kind of trial and error body from the Sun/Earth perspective, what's the difference in the emanation coming from their nodal connectedness with people?_

**Ra:** Oh, this person, their active, assimilating frequency would immediately go to work and they would probably bump into this other person just to be able to see if they could hook up with them or something like that. I'm just talking off the top of my head.

We come back to this illustration where we see the Sun/Earth again. Really understand how limited the Sun/Earths are in terms of what they can do for our life in the sense that they bring enhancement or enrichment, the keynotes of the Center for Human Differentiation. They bring enhancement and enrichment. That's what they do. They bring enhancement and enrichment to the cognitive potential of the story line.

We know the enhancement comes from dietary regimen and we know the enrichment comes from passenger consciousness. This is the story. So, it's why, over the years, particularly the last four or five years, I finally got off the Sun/Earth bandwagon because I had to teach that so long to get people to begin to see their mechanism. Here you can really see the way things are. Yes, the Sun/Earth gets all the publicity. That's what they get. But the life, the life is built on the external.

### Is the Sun/Earth the Costume of the Role Play?

_Question:_ _So the Sun/Earth is basically the costume of the role play?_

**Ra:**: Yes, it is fundamentally the way we're presented to the world, because it gives us our presentation. It gives us the way we conceptualize, it gives us basically the way in which we are going to perform the script that we have been given. When you're aware, the script comes alive and it comes alive with all the nuances of your differentiation. That's the beauty.

_Written comment: casting._
**Ra:**: Yes, casting, indeed.

One day, Adrian, you have to tell me how many possible story lines there are and how many possible cognitive potentials there are because I assume there are millions. It's really amazing. Yes, it is casting, but now what a cast. What did they used to call those things--blockbusters? Yeah, it's a big movie.

## The G Center Itself is Not the Identity

_Question: When you went through all those nodal oppositions you did years ago in the JAM, and it's still in the free JAM Player, it was always this emphasis that the Nodes were actually the environment and not something to take as an identification. I think this is just a repeat of casting and watching the movie. I'm not sure if I have that right._

**Ra:** I think I understand your point. Every single one of the things that I teach I have to teach deconstructed. This is all deconstructed. It really is. There is so much that we can look at. We all know that. There is only one identity. It's interesting because today I filmed _The Diamond at the Center of Being_ this morning. I think it will come out on Saturday. It's focusing on the G Center and the wonder of the G Center.

One of the things I said this morning that I think is something everyone with an open G Center needs to realize: The G Center itself is not the identity. It is the potential through the G Center to create the holistic identity--the Monopole and the G Center, the Link Nodes, the capture frequency, all of things we understand. It is this holistic frequency that is the life. It is this holistic frequency that is layer upon layer of the attributes that we give little names to.

Whether it is the cognitive potential of the story line, which is simply about how you frame what you see in the place that you are, or the lunar and planetary squares with their experiential phenomena, or the Sun/Earths with their cross and their purpose, in the end, you have to take all of it. All of it together is synthesized into the life.

So, there is no way I want to give the false impression that I'm suggesting the whole story is here. What I'm saying is that this is the story ingredient in the holistic life. Every life has a story. It's just there. That story is based on the experience. It is based on the awareness, it is based on so many things and we have to see that all within the larger holistic context. We're explorers at a very scientific level of this knowledge. At this level, deconstruction leads to labeling and labeling can be taken out of context. So beware.

## What is Key for Teenagers to Understand?

_Question:_ If you were talking to this person and he's standing there as a 15 year-old young man, what would the gist of the story line be that you mention for his signposts?

**Ra:** I think basically the key is the emotional system. I would really explain to this person that it's only through understanding how their emotions work that they're ever going to have the friends in their life that they really, really want and need to have. Without operating correctly out of the emotional system, they will never be able to have that in their lives. So, at that level, it's very simple.

One of the things that I'm doing in Ibiza this year, what I'm really looking forward to, is on my birthday in the morning, I'm going to be doing a session with teenagers and taking them through Strategy and Authority and Signature for free. It's a very different language. When you're dealing with a teenager, the key for them is what their authority is and what has happened to them through their openness, because they're all very aware of their discomorts, all teenagers are, of the discomorts of their Personality. They really don't understand many things about themselves. Openness is a great key for them at a very simple level, to understand what that does and how that affects their mind. This is something that is really transforming for them; but again, kept very simple.

For a young boy, the story of their life, it's not time yet. They can wait until they're 30. But I certainly would let them know, obviously, it's in their design. This is somebody who, the social dynamic of their life is going to be one of the most important things for them. They're going to feel compelled in their life to be an agent of community and holding community together and being part of community. They're going to be very wrapped up in it.

It means from a very early age, because they're a 4/6, we know that 4/6s in the first 30 years of their life that their great dilemma is making the wrong friends, trial and error in friendship leading to everything from herpes to death. I don't mean to be too dramatic, but what the hell, I like that. Again, I'm a simplest. I have to be. I see that human beings are so messed up and they've been only confused, so you have to be very, very simple to get to them. The truth is simple, after all. With kids, particularly, you have to work in sound bytes that are specifically directed at them. I certainly wouldn't bring in environmental things and all that kind of stuff.

I certainly would mention to them PHS, not in any sense that it's something that they should do, but something to let them know that this would be very good for them, and see whether or not it's a natural thing for them to gravitate to. In other words, for children it's very important that they understand their type, their strategy and what kind of dietary regimen is healthy for them. It's obviously not about forcing them or telling them that they have to. They have parents who would be very resistant to certain dietary regimens and these kinds of things.

But again, the responsibility is to give the simple truths that are appropriate to the time. If this was a child, boy or girl, a teenager, my concern for them would be social, only social, to really understand that their life is built on the social dynamic and they're in a time in their life where they can make a lot of mistakes and they need to know how to make decisions about people.

### North Node Migrating to the Unconscious Side?

_Question:_ _Ra, in terms of this North Node that has migrated over on the cognitive potential side, because it's related to the body, does it still carry that same value of being something that's unconscious that we use when we speak about, say, the foundation reading and we tell people well, it's your body side so you're not going to be able to cognize what that's about?_

Ra:The fact that we do a transposition in order to understand the mechanism doesn't mean that this is not Personality. It is Personality. As I said earlier, I think one of the most important things to understand about tonal transposition is that from the Personality side, when you're looking at it in this way, what you're really getting to see is that the Personality is recognizing the body. And this is the only gate and the only activation in which the Personality recognizes the vehicle. This is incredibly important.

Again, this is the magic of it. In the same way from the Design side over in the transposition, this is a gate that understands the needs of the Personality. In other words, this is what makes it so special. So, in the sense of the Personality, it is something who you think you are. So when you're looking at your Personality Link Node, you're also looking at something that will tune into your body. Again, in the holistic sense this is something that is very important. It may be a key one day to understanding what is the easiest way to get people to enter into their Strategy and Authority, frankly. I think it could be quite a key.

That's something to think about. That's a nice inspiring point to leave off on. I hope you enjoyed that. Good questions, by the way; thank you Kumud for asking questions for everyone. To all of you, you take care. I'll see you tomorrow and we'll see where we go. Until then, bye for now.
